<i>Introduction.</i></p>

<p class="nind">
IN order to explain the results of experiments on scattering of a rays
by matter Prof. Rutherford<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> has given a theory of the structure of
atoms. According to this theory, the atoms consist of a positively
charged nucleus surrounded by a system of electrons kept together by
attractive forces from the nucleus; the total negative charge of the
electrons is equal to the positive charge of the nucleus. Further, the
nucleus is assumed to be the seat of the essential part of the mass
of the atom, and to have linear dimensions exceedingly small compared
with the linear dimensions of the whole atom. The number of electrons
in an atom is deduced to be approximately equal to half the atomic
weight. Great interest is to be attributed to this atom-model; for, as
Rutherford has shown, the assumption of the existence of nuclei, as
those in question, seems to be necessary in order to account for the
results of the experiments on large angle scattering of the <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.448ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/99.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\alpha">
rays<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>.</p>

<p>In an attempt to explain some of the properties of matter on the
basis of this atom-model we meet, however, with difficulties of a
serious nature arising from the apparent instability of the system of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</span>
electrons: difficulties purposely avoided in atom-models previously
considered, for instance, in the one proposed by Sir J. J. Thomson<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>.
According to the theory of the latter the atom consists of a sphere of
uniform positive electrification, inside which the electrons move in
circular orbits.</p>

<p>The principal difference between the atom-models proposed by Thomson
and Rutherford consists in the circumstance that the forces acting
on the electrons in the atom-model of Thomson allow of certain
configurations and motions of the electrons for which the system is
in a stable equilibrium; such configurations, however, apparently do
not exist for the second atom-model. The nature of the difference in
question will perhaps be most clearly seen by noticing that among the
quantities characterizing the first atom a quantity appears—the radius
of the positive sphere—of dimensions of a length and of the same order
of magnitude as the linear extension of the atom, while such a length
does not appear among the quantities characterizing the second atom,
viz. the charges and masses of the electrons and the positive nucleus;
nor can it be determined solely by help of the latter quantities.</p>

<p>The way of considering a problem of this kind has, however, undergone
essential alterations in recent years owing to the development of the
theory of the energy radiation, and the direct affirmation of the new
assumptions introduced in this theory, found by experiments on very
different phenomena such as specific heats, photo-electric effect,
Röntgen-rays, &amp;c. The result of the discussion of these questions seems
to be a general acknowledgment of the inadequacy of the classical
electrodynamics in describing the behaviour of systems of atomic
size<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>. Whatever the alteration in the laws of motion of the electrons
may be, it seems necessary to introduce in the laws in question a
quantity foreign to the classical electrodynamics, <i>i. e.</i>
Planck’s constant, or as it often is called the elementary quantum of
action. By the introduction of this quantity the question of the stable
configuration of the electrons in the atoms is essentially changed, as
this constant is of such dimensions and magnitude that it, together
with the mass and charge of the particles, can determine a length of
the order of magnitude required.</p>

<p>This paper is an attempt to show that the application of the above
ideas to Rutherford’s atom-model affords a basis for a theory of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</span>
constitution of atoms. It will further be shown that from this theory
we are led to a theory of the constitution of molecules.</p>

<p>In the present first part of the paper the mechanism of the binding of
electrons by a positive nucleus is discussed in relation to Planck's
theory. It will be shown that it is possible from the point of view
taken to account in a simple way for the law of the line spectrum of
hydrogen. Further, reasons are given for a principal hypothesis on
which the considerations contained in the following parts are based.</p>

<p>I wish here to express my thanks to Prof. Rutherford for his kind and
encouraging interest in this work.</p>

<p class="nindc space-above2 space-below2">
§1. <i>General Considerations.</i></p>


<p>The inadequacy of the classical electrodynamics in accounting for the
properties of atoms from an atom-model as Rutherford’s, will appear
very clearly if we consider a simple system consisting of a positively
charged nucleus of very small dimensions and an electron describing
closed orbits around it. For simplicity, let us assume that the mass
of the electron is negligibly small in comparison with that of the
nucleus, and further, that the velocity of the electron is small
compared with that of light.</p>

<p>Let us at first assume that there is no energy radiation. In this case
the electron will describe stationary elliptical orbits. The frequency
of revolution <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.407ex; height: 1.027ex;" src="images/100.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\omega"> and the major-axis of the orbit <img style="vertical-align: -0.023ex; width: 2.328ex; height: 1.529ex;" src="images/101.svg" alt=" " data-tex="2a"> will
depend on the amount of energy <img style="vertical-align: -0.05ex; width: 2.371ex; height: 1.595ex;" src="images/102.svg" alt=" " data-tex="W"> which must be transferred to
the system in order to remove the electron to an infinitely great
distance apart from the nucleus. Denoting the charge of the electron
and of the nucleus by <img style="vertical-align: -0.186ex; width: 2.814ex; height: 1.505ex;" src="images/103.svg" alt=" " data-tex="-e"> and <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 1.729ex; height: 1.538ex;" src="images/104.svg" alt=" " data-tex="E"> respectively and the mass of
the electron by <span class="nowrap"><img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.986ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/105.svg" alt=" " data-tex="m">,</span> we thus get
<span class="align-center"><img style="vertical-align: -2.308ex; width: 36.361ex; height: 6.823ex;" src="images/1.svg" alt=" " data-tex="
\omega = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{\pi}\, \frac{W^{\tfrac{3}{2}}}{eE \sqrt{m}},
\quad 2a = \frac{eE}{W}
\qquad \text{(1)}
"></span>
Further, it can easily be shown that the mean value of
the kinetic energy of the electron taken for a whole revolution is
equal to <span class="nowrap"><img style="vertical-align: -0.05ex; width: 2.371ex; height: 1.595ex;" src="images/102.svg" alt=" " data-tex="W">.</span> We see that if the value of <img style="vertical-align: -0.05ex; width: 2.371ex; height: 1.595ex;" src="images/102.svg" alt=" " data-tex="W"> is not given, there
will be no values of <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.407ex; height: 1.027ex;" src="images/100.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\omega"> and <img style="vertical-align: -0.023ex; width: 1.197ex; height: 1.02ex;" src="images/106.svg" alt=" " data-tex="a"> characteristic for the system
in question.</p>

<p>Let us now, however, take the effect of the energy radiation into
account, calculated in the ordinary way from the acceleration of
the electron. In this case the electron will no longer describe
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span>
stationary orbits. <img style="vertical-align: -0.05ex; width: 2.371ex; height: 1.595ex;" src="images/102.svg" alt=" " data-tex="W"> will continuously increase, and the electron
will approach the nucleus describing orbits of smaller and smaller
dimensions, and with greater and greater frequency; the electron on the
average gaining in kinetic energy at the same time as the whole system
loses energy. This process will go on until the dimensions of the orbit
are of the same order of magnitude as the dimensions of the electron
or those of the nucleus. A simple calculation shows that the energy
radiated out during the process considered will be enormously great
compared with that radiated out by ordinary molecular processes.</p>

<p>It is obvious that the behaviour of such a system will be very
different from that of an atomic system occurring in nature. In the
first place, the actual atoms in their permanent state seem to have
absolutely fixed dimensions and frequencies. Further, if we consider
any molecular process, the result seems always to be that after a
certain amount of energy characteristic for the systems in question is
radiated out, the systems will again settle down in a stable state of
equilibrium, in which the distances apart of the particles are of the
same order of magnitude as before the process.</p>

<p>Now the essential point in Planck’s theory of radiation is that the
energy radiation from an atomic system does not take place in the
continuous way assumed in the ordinary electrodynamics, but that it, on
the contrary, takes place in distinctly separated emissions, the amount
of energy radiated out from an atomic vibrator of frequency <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 1.199ex; height: 1ex;" src="images/107.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\nu"> in
a single emission being equal to <span class="nowrap"><img style="vertical-align: -0.029ex; width: 3.672ex; height: 1.6ex;" src="images/108.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\tau h \nu">,</span> where <img style="vertical-align: -0.029ex; width: 1.17ex; height: 1.005ex;" src="images/109.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\tau"> is an
entire number, and <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.303ex; height: 1.595ex;" src="images/110.svg" alt=" " data-tex="h"> is a universal constant<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>.</p>

<p>Returning to the simple case of an electron and a positive nucleus
considered above, let us assume that the electron at the beginning of
the interaction with the nucleus was at a great distance apart from
the nucleus, and had no sensible velocity relative to the latter. Let
us further assume that the electron after the interaction has taken
place has settled down in a stationary orbit around the nucleus. We
shall, for reasons referred to later, assume that the orbit in question
is circular; this assumption will, however, make no alteration in the
calculations for systems containing only a single electron.</p>

<p>Let us now assume that, during the binding of the electron, a
homogeneous radiation is emitted of a frequency <span class="nowrap"><img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 1.199ex; height: 1ex;" src="images/107.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\nu">,</span> equal to half
the frequency of revolution of the electron in its final orbit; then,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span>
from Planck's theory, we might expect that the amount of energy emitted
by the process considered is equal to <span class="nowrap"><img style="vertical-align: -0.029ex; width: 3.672ex; height: 1.6ex;" src="images/108.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\tau h \nu">,</span> where <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.303ex; height: 1.595ex;" src="images/110.svg" alt=" " data-tex="h"> is
Planck’s constant and <img style="vertical-align: -0.029ex; width: 1.17ex; height: 1.005ex;" src="images/109.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\tau"> an entire number. If we assume that the
radiation emitted is homogeneous, the second assumption concerning the
frequency of the radiation suggests itself, since the frequency of
revolution of the electron at the beginning of the emission is <span class="nowrap"><img style="vertical-align: -0.05ex; width: 1.131ex; height: 1.557ex;" src="images/111.svg" alt=" " data-tex="0">.</span> The
question, however, of the rigorous validity of both assumptions, and
also of the application made of Planck’s theory, will be more closely
discussed in <a href="#3">§3</a>.</p>

<p>Putting
<span class="align-center"><img style="vertical-align: -1.552ex; width: 17.68ex; height: 4.084ex;" src="images/2.svg" alt=" " data-tex=" W = \tau h \frac{ \omega }{2}
\qquad \text{(2)}
"></span>
we get by help of the formula (1)
<span class="align-center"><img style="vertical-align: -1.658ex; width: 60.813ex; height: 5.074ex;" src="images/3.svg" alt=" " data-tex="
W = \frac{2 \pi ^{2}me^{2}E^{2}}{\tau ^{2}h^{2}}, \quad \omega
= \frac{4 \pi ^{2}me^{2}E^{2}}{ \tau^{3}h^{3}}, \quad 2a
= \frac{ \tau ^{2}h^{2}}{2 \pi ^{2}meE}
\qquad\text{(3)}
"></span></p>

<p>If in these expressions we give <img style="vertical-align: -0.029ex; width: 1.17ex; height: 1.005ex;" src="images/109.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\tau"> different values, we get
a series of values for <span class="nowrap"><img style="vertical-align: -0.05ex; width: 2.371ex; height: 1.595ex;" src="images/102.svg" alt=" " data-tex="W">,</span> <span class="nowrap"><img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.407ex; height: 1.027ex;" src="images/100.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\omega">,</span> and <img style="vertical-align: -0.023ex; width: 1.197ex; height: 1.02ex;" src="images/106.svg" alt=" " data-tex="a"> corresponding
to a series of configurations of the system. According to the above
considerations, we are led to assume that these configurations will
correspond to states of the system in which there is no radiation of
energy; states which consequently will be stationary as long as the
system is not disturbed from outside. We see that the value of <img style="vertical-align: -0.05ex; width: 2.371ex; height: 1.595ex;" src="images/102.svg" alt=" " data-tex="W"> is
greatest if <img style="vertical-align: -0.029ex; width: 1.17ex; height: 1.005ex;" src="images/109.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\tau"> has its smallest value <span class="nowrap"><img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 1.131ex; height: 1.507ex;" src="images/112.svg" alt=" " data-tex="1">.</span> This case will therefore
correspond to the most stable state of the system, <i>i. e</i>. will
correspond to the binding of the electron for the breaking up of which
the greatest amount of energy is required.</p>

<p>Putting in the above expressions <img style="vertical-align: -0.186ex; width: 5.318ex; height: 1.692ex;" src="images/113.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\tau =1"> and <span class="nowrap"><img style="vertical-align: -0.186ex; width: 5.8ex; height: 1.724ex;" src="images/114.svg" alt=" " data-tex="E = e">,</span> and
introducing the experimental values
<span class="align-center"><img style="vertical-align: -1.577ex; width: 50.905ex; height: 4.106ex;" src="images/4.svg" alt=" " data-tex="

\quad h = 6.5 \cdot 10^{-27},
"></span>
we get
<span class="align-center"><img style="vertical-align: -1.577ex; width: 56.566ex; height: 4.652ex;" src="images/5.svg" alt=" " data-tex="

\quad
\omega = 6.2 \cdot 10^{15}\, \frac{1}{\text{sec.}},
\quad
\frac{W}{e} = 13\, \text{volt}.
"></span></p>

<p>We see that these values are of the same order of magnitude as the
linear dimensions of the atoms, the optical frequencies, and the
ionization-potentials.</p>

<p>The general importance of Planck’s theory for the discussion of the
behaviour of atomic systems was originally pointed out by Einstein<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>.
The considerations of Einstein have been developed and applied on
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>
a number of different phenomena, especially by Stark, Nernst, and
Sommerfield. The agreement as to the order of magnitude between values
observed for the frequencies and dimensions of the atoms, and values
for these quantities calculated by considerations similar to those
given above, has been the subject of much discussion. It was first
pointed out by Haas<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>, in an attempt to explain the meaning and the
value of Planck’s constant on the basis of J. J. Thomson’s atom-model,
by help of the linear dimensions and frequency of an hydrogen atom.</p>

<p>Systems of the kind considered in this paper, in which the forces
between the particles vary inversely as the square of the distance,
are discussed in relation to Planck’s theory by J. W. Nicholson<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>. In
a series of papers this author has shown that it seems to be possible
to account for lines of hitherto unknown origin in the spectra of the
stellar nebulæ and that of the solar corona, by assuming the presence
in these bodies of certain hypothetical elements of exactly indicated
constitution. The atoms of these elements are supposed to consist
simply of a ring of a few electrons surrounding a positive nucleus
of negligibly small dimensions. The ratios between the frequencies
corresponding to the lines in question are compared with the ratios
between the frequencies corresponding to different modes of vibration
of the ring of electrons. Nicholson has obtained a relation to Planck’s
theory showing that the ratios between the wave-length of different
sets of lines of the coronal spectrum can be accounted for with great
accuracy by assuming that the ratio between the energy of the system
and the frequency of rotation of the ring is equal to an entire
multiple of Planck’s constant. The quantity Nicholson refers to as the
energy is equal to twice the quantity which we have denoted above by
<span class="nowrap"><img style="vertical-align: -0.05ex; width: 2.371ex; height: 1.595ex;" src="images/102.svg" alt=" " data-tex="W">.</span> In the latest paper cited Nicholson has found it necessary to
give the theory a more complicated form, still, however, representing
the ratio of energy to frequency by a simple function of whole numbers.</p>

<p>The excellent agreement between the calculated and observed values
of the ratios between the wave-lengths in question seems a strong
argument in favour of the validity of the foundation of Nicholson’s
calculations. Serious objections, however, may be raised against the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span>
theory. These objections are intimately connected with the problem of
the homogeneity of the radiation emitted. In Nicholson’s calculations
the frequency of lines in a line-spectrum is identified with the
frequency of vibration of a mechanical system in a distinctly indicated
state of equilibrium. As a relation from Planck's theory is used, we
might expect that the radiation is sent out in quanta; but systems like
those considered, in which the frequency is a function of the energy,
cannot emit a finite amount of a homogeneous radiation; for, as soon as
the emission of radiation is started, the energy and also the frequency
of the system are altered. Further, according to the calculation of
Nicholson, the systems are unstable for some modes of vibration. Apart
from such objections—which may be only formal (see <a href="#Page_23">p. 23</a>)—it must be
remarked, that the theory in the form given does not seem to be able to
account for the well-known laws of Balmer and Rydberg connecting the
frequencies of the lines in the line-spectra of the ordinary elements.</p>

<p>It will now be attempted to show that the difficulties in question
disappear if we consider the problems from the point of view taken
in this paper. Before proceeding it may be useful to restate briefly
the ideas characterizing the calculations on <a href="#Page_5">p. 5</a>. The principal
assumptions used are:</p>

<p class="hanging2">
(1) That the dynamical equilibrium of the systems in the stationary
states can be discussed by help of the ordinary mechanics, while the
passing of the systems between different stationary states cannot be
treated on that basis.</p>

<p class="hanging2">
(2) That the latter process is followed by the emission of a
homogeneous radiation, for which the relation between the frequency and
the amount of energy emitted is the one given by Planck's theory.</p>

<p>The first assumption seems to present itself; for it is known that the
ordinary mechanics cannot have an absolute validity, but will only hold
in calculations of certain mean values of the motion of the electrons.
On the other hand, in the calculations of the dynamical equilibrium
in a stationary state in which there is no relative displacement of
the particles, we need not distinguish between the actual motions and
their mean values. The second assumption is in obvious contrast to the
ordinary ideas of electrodynamics, but appears to be necessary in order
to account for experimental facts.</p>

<p>In the calculations on <a href="#Page_5">page 5</a> we have further made use of the more
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>
special assumptions, viz. that the different stationary states
correspond to the emission of a different number of Planck’s
energy-quanta, and that the frequency of the radiation emitted during
the passing of the system from a state in which no energy is yet
radiated out to one of the stationary states, is equal to half the
frequency of revolution of the electron in the latter state. We can,
however (see <a href="#3">§3</a>), also arrive at the expressions (3) for the stationary
states by using assumptions of somewhat different form. We shall,
therefore, postpone the discussion of the special assumptions, and
first show how by the help of the above principal assumptions, and of
the expressions (3) for the stationary states, we can account for the
line-spectrum of hydrogen.</p>


<p class="nindc space-above2 space-below2">
§2. <i>Emission of Line-spectra.</i></p>


<p><i>Spectrum of Hydrogen</i>.—General evidence indicates that an atom
of hydrogen consists simply of a single electron rotating round a
positive nucleus of charge <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.054ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/115.svg" alt=" " data-tex="e"><a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>. The reformation of a hydrogen
atom, when the electron has been removed to great distances away from
the nucleus—<i>e. g.</i>. by the effect of electrical discharge
in a vacuum tube—will accordingly correspond to the binding of an
electron by a positive nucleus considered on <a href="#Page_5">p. 5</a>. If in (3) we put
<span class="nowrap"><img style="vertical-align: -0.186ex; width: 5.8ex; height: 1.724ex;" src="images/114.svg" alt=" " data-tex="E = e">,</span> we get for the total amount of energy radiated out by the

<p>The amount of energy emitted by the passing of the system from a
state corresponding to <img style="vertical-align: -0.339ex; width: 6.163ex; height: 1.658ex;" src="images/116.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\tau = \tau_{1}"> to one corresponding to

<p>If now we suppose that the radiation in question is homogeneous,
and that the amount of energy emitted is equal to <span class="nowrap"><img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 2.502ex; height: 1.595ex;" src="images/118.svg" alt=" " data-tex="h \nu">,</span>
where <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 1.199ex; height: 1ex;" src="images/107.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\nu"> is the frequency of the radiation, we get

<p>We see that this expression accounts for the law connecting the
lines in the spectrum of hydrogen. If we put <img style="vertical-align: -0.339ex; width: 6.125ex; height: 1.846ex;" src="images/119.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\tau_{2} = 2"> and
let <img style="vertical-align: -0.339ex; width: 1.976ex; height: 1.314ex;" src="images/120.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\tau_{1}"> vary, we get the ordinary Balmer series. If
we put <span class="nowrap"><img style="vertical-align: -0.339ex; width: 6.125ex; height: 1.844ex;" src="images/121.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\tau_{2} = 3">,</span> we get the series in the ultra-red

<p>The agreement in question is quantitative as well as qualitative.

The observed value for the factor outside the bracket in the
formula (4) is
<span class="align-center"><img style="vertical-align: -0.05ex; width: 11.467ex; height: 2.05ex;" src="images/11.svg" alt=" " data-tex="
3.290 \cdot 10^{15}.
"></span></p>

<p>The agreement between the theoretical and observed values is inside the
uncertainty due to experimental errors in the constants entering in the
expression for the theoretical value. We shall in <a href="#3">§3</a> return to consider
the possible importance of the agreement in question.</p>

<p>It may be remarked that the fact, that it has not been possible to
observe more than <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 2.262ex; height: 1.507ex;" src="images/124.svg" alt=" " data-tex="12"> lines of the Balmer series in experiments with
vacuum tubes, while <img style="vertical-align: -0.05ex; width: 2.262ex; height: 1.554ex;" src="images/125.svg" alt=" " data-tex="33"> lines are observed in the spectra of some
celestial bodies, is just what we should expect from the above theory.
According to the equation (3) the diameter of the orbit of the electron
in the different stationary states is proportional to <span class="nowrap"><img style="vertical-align: -0.029ex; width: 2.28ex; height: 1.916ex;" src="images/126.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\tau ^{2}">.</span>
For <img style="vertical-align: -0.186ex; width: 6.449ex; height: 1.692ex;" src="images/127.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\tau = 12"> the diameter is equal to <span class="nowrap"><img style="vertical-align: -0.05ex; width: 12.917ex; height: 2.005ex;" src="images/128.svg" alt=" " data-tex="1.6 \cdot 10^{-6}\, \text{cm.}">,</span>

necessary condition for the appearance of a great number of lines is
therefore a very small density of the gas; for simultaneously to obtain
an intensity sufficient for observation the space tilled with the gas
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>
must be very great. If the theory is right, we may therefore never
expect to be able in experiments with vacuum tubes to observe the lines
corresponding to high numbers of the Balmer series of the emission
spectrum of hydrogen; it might, however, be possible to observe the
lines by investigation of the absorption spectrum of this gas (see <a href="#4">§4</a>).</p>

<p>It will be observed that we in the above way do not obtain other
series of lines, generally ascribed to hydrogen; for instance, the
series first observed by Pickering<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> in the spectrum of the star
<img style="vertical-align: -0.462ex; width: 1.066ex; height: 2.054ex;" src="images/133.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\zeta"> Puppis, and the set of series recently found by Fowler<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>
by experiments with vacuum tubes containing a mixture of hydrogen and
helium. We shall, however, see that, by help of the above theory, we
can account naturally for these series of lines if we ascribe them to
helium.</p>

<p>A neutral atom of the latter element consists, according to
Rutherford’s theory, of a positive nucleus of charge <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 2.186ex; height: 1.532ex;" src="images/134.svg" alt=" " data-tex="2e">
and two electrons. Now considering the binding of a single
electron by a helium nucleus, we get, putting <img style="vertical-align: -0.186ex; width: 6.931ex; height: 1.724ex;" src="images/135.svg" alt=" " data-tex="E = 2e"> in
the expressions (3) on <a href="#Page_5">page 5</a>, and proceeding in exactly the
same way as above,
<span class="align-center"><img style="vertical-align: -2.827ex; width: 55.995ex; height: 6.785ex;" src="images/12.svg" alt=" " data-tex="
\nu = \frac{8 \pi^{2}me^{4}}{h^{3}}
\left(\dfrac{1}{\tau_2^{2}} - \dfrac{1}{\tau_1^{2}}\right)

\left(\frac{1}{(\frac{\tau_{2}}{2})^{2}} - \frac{1}{(\frac{\tau_{1}}{2})^{2}}\right).
"></span></p>

<p>If we in this formula put <img style="vertical-align: -0.339ex; width: 6.125ex; height: 1.846ex;" src="images/122.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\tau_{2} = 1"> or <span class="nowrap"><img style="vertical-align: -0.339ex; width: 6.125ex; height: 1.846ex;" src="images/119.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\tau_{2} = 2">,</span>
we get series of lines in the extreme ultra-violet. If we put
<span class="nowrap"><img style="vertical-align: -0.339ex; width: 6.125ex; height: 1.844ex;" src="images/121.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\tau_{2} = 3">,</span> and let <img style="vertical-align: -0.339ex; width: 1.976ex; height: 1.314ex;" src="images/120.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\tau_{1}"> vary, we get a series which
includes <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 1.131ex; height: 1.507ex;" src="images/136.svg" alt=" " data-tex="2"> of the series observed by Fowler, and denoted by him as
the first and second principal series of the hydrogen spectrum. If we
put <span class="nowrap"><img style="vertical-align: -0.339ex; width: 6.125ex; height: 1.871ex;" src="images/137.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\tau_{2} = 4">,</span> we get the series observed by Pickering in the
spectrum of <img style="vertical-align: -0.462ex; width: 1.066ex; height: 2.054ex;" src="images/133.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\zeta"> Puppis. Every second of the lines in this series
is identical with a line in the Balmer series of the hydrogen spectrum;
the presence of hydrogen in the star in question may therefore account
for the fact that these lines are of a greater intensity than the
rest of the lines in the series. The series is also observed in the
experiments of Fowler, and denoted in his paper as the Sharp series
of the hydrogen spectrum. If we finally in the above formula put
<span class="nowrap"><img style="vertical-align: -0.439ex; width: 12.852ex; height: 1.946ex;" src="images/138.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\tau_{2} = 5,\, 6,~...">,</span> we get series, the strong lines of which
are to be expected in the ultra-red.</p>

<p>The reason why the spectrum considered is not observed in ordinary
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>
helium tubes may be that in such tubes the ionization of helium is not
so complete as in the star considered or in the experiments of Fowler,
where a strong discharge was sent through a mixture of hydrogen and
helium. The condition for the appearance of the spectrum is, according
to the above theory, that helium atoms are present in a state in which
they have lost both their electrons. Now we must assume that the amount
of energy to be used in removing the second electron from a helium atom
is much greater than that to be used in removing the first. Further,
it is known from experiments on positive rays, that hydrogen atoms can
acquire a negative charge; therefore the presence of hydrogen in the
experiments of Fowler may effect that more electrons are removed from
some of the helium atoms than would be the case if only helium were
present.</p>

<p><i>Spectra of other substances</i>.—In case of systems containing more
electrons we must—in conformity with the result of experiments—expect
more complicated laws for the line-spectra than those considered. I
shall try to show that the point of view taken above allows, at any
rate, a certain understanding of the laws observed.</p>

<p>According to Rydberg’s theory—with the generalization given by
Ritz<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>—the frequency corresponding to the lines of the spectrum
of an element can be expressed by
<span class="align-center"><img style="vertical-align: -0.566ex; width: 19.212ex; height: 2.262ex;" src="images/13.svg" alt=" " data-tex="

where <span class="nowrap"><img style="vertical-align: -0.339ex; width: 1.976ex; height: 1.314ex;" src="images/120.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\tau_{1}">,</span> and <span class="nowrap"><img style="vertical-align: -0.339ex; width: 1.976ex; height: 1.314ex;" src="images/139.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\tau_{2}">,</span> are entire numbers,
and <span class="nowrap"><img style="vertical-align: -0.339ex; width: 2.442ex; height: 1.878ex;" src="images/140.svg" alt=" " data-tex="F_{1}">,</span> <span class="nowrap"><img style="vertical-align: -0.339ex; width: 2.442ex; height: 1.878ex;" src="images/141.svg" alt=" " data-tex="F_{2}">,</span> <span class="nowrap"><img style="vertical-align: -0.339ex; width: 2.442ex; height: 1.878ex;" src="images/141.svg" alt=" " data-tex="F_{2}">,</span>.... are functions of <img style="vertical-align: -0.029ex; width: 1.17ex; height: 1.005ex;" src="images/109.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\tau">

<span class="nowrap"><img style="vertical-align: -2.194ex; width: 9.863ex; height: 5.269ex;" src="images/143.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\dfrac{K}{( \tau + a_2)^{2}}">,</span>.... <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 2.011ex; height: 1.545ex;" src="images/144.svg" alt=" " data-tex="K"> is a universal constant, equal
to the factor outside the bracket in the formula (4) for the spectrum
of hydrogen. The different series appear if we put <span class="nowrap"><img style="vertical-align: -0.339ex; width: 1.976ex; height: 1.314ex;" src="images/120.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\tau_{1}">,</span> or

<p>The circumstance that the frequency can be written as a difference
between two functions of entire numbers suggests an origin of the lines
in the spectra in question similar to the one we have assumed for
hydrogen; <i>i. e</i>. that the lines correspond to a radiation emitted
during the passing of the system between two different stationary
states. For systems containing more than one electron the detailed
discussion may be very complicated, as there will be many different
configurations of the electrons which can be taken into consideration
as stationary states. This may account for the different sets of series
in the line spectra emitted from the substances in question. Here I
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>
shall only try to show how, by help of the theory, it can be simply
explained that the constant <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 2.011ex; height: 1.545ex;" src="images/144.svg" alt=" " data-tex="K"> entering in Rydberg’s formula is the
same for all substances.</p>

<p>Let us assume that the spectrum in question corresponds to the
radiation emitted during the binding of an electron; and let us further
assume that the system including the electron considered is neutral.
The force on the electron, when at a great distance apart from the
nucleus and the electrons previously bound, will be very nearly the
same as in the above case of the binding of an electron by a hydrogen
nucleus. The energy corresponding to one of the stationary states will
therefore for <img style="vertical-align: -0.029ex; width: 1.17ex; height: 1.005ex;" src="images/109.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\tau"> great be very nearly equal to that given by the
expression (3) on <a href="#Page_5">p. 5</a>, if we put <span class="nowrap"><img style="vertical-align: -0.186ex; width: 5.8ex; height: 1.724ex;" src="images/114.svg" alt=" " data-tex="E = e">.</span> For <img style="vertical-align: -0.029ex; width: 1.17ex; height: 1.005ex;" src="images/109.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\tau"> great we

in conformity with Rydberg’s theory.</p>


<p class="nindc space-above2 space-below2">
<a id="3">§3. <i>General Considerations continued.</i></a></p>


<p>We shall now return to the discussion (see <a href="#Page_7">p. 7</a>) of the special
assumptions used in deducing the expressions (3) on <a href="#Page_5">p. 5</a> for the
stationary states of a system consisting of an electron rotating round
a nucleus.</p>

<p>For one, we have assumed that the different stationary states
correspond to an emission of a different number of energy-quanta.
Considering systems in which the frequency is a function of the energy,
this assumption, however, may be regarded as improbable; for as soon as
one quantum is sent out the frequency is altered. We shall now see that
we can leave the assumption used and still retain the equation (2) on
<a href="#Page_5">p. 5</a>, and thereby the formal analogy with Planck’s theory.</p>

<p>Firstly, it will be observed that it has not been necessary, in order
to account for the law of the spectra by help of the expressions (3)
for the stationary states, to assume that in any case a radiation is
sent out corresponding to more than a single energy-quantum, <span class="nowrap"><img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 2.502ex; height: 1.595ex;" src="images/118.svg" alt=" " data-tex="h \nu">.</span>
Further information on the frequency of the radiation may be obtained
by comparing calculations of the energy radiation in the region of slow
vibrations based on the above assumptions with calculations based on
the ordinary mechanics. As is known, calculations on the latter basis
are in agreement with experiments on the energy radiation in the named
region.</p>

<p>Let us assume that the ratio between the total amount of energy
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>
emitted and the frequency of revolution of the electron for the
different stationary states is given by the equation
<span class="nowrap"><img style="vertical-align: -0.566ex; width: 13.907ex; height: 2.262ex;" src="images/145.svg" alt=" " data-tex="W = f( \tau ) \cdot h \omega">,</span> instead of by the equation (2).
Proceeding in the same way as above, we get in this case instead of (3)
<span class="align-center"><img style="vertical-align: -2.194ex; width: 33.977ex; height: 5.611ex;" src="images/15.svg" alt=" " data-tex="
W = \frac{\pi ^{2}me^{2}E^{2}}{2h^{2}f^{2}( \tau) },
\quad \omega = \frac{ \pi ^{2}me^{2}E^{2}}{2h^{3}f^{3}( \tau) }.
"></span></p>

<p>Assuming as above that the amount of energy emitted during the passing
of the system from a state corresponding to <img style="vertical-align: -0.339ex; width: 6.163ex; height: 1.658ex;" src="images/116.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\tau = \tau_{1}"> to one
for which <img style="vertical-align: -0.339ex; width: 6.163ex; height: 1.658ex;" src="images/117.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\tau = \tau_{2}"> is equal to <span class="nowrap"><img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 2.502ex; height: 1.595ex;" src="images/146.svg" alt=" " data-tex="h\nu">,</span> we get instead of
(4)

Balmer series we must <span class="nowrap"><img style="vertical-align: -0.566ex; width: 9.341ex; height: 2.262ex;" src="images/147.svg" alt=" " data-tex="f(\tau) = c \tau">.</span></p>

<p>In order to determine <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 0.98ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/148.svg" alt=" " data-tex="c"> let us now consider the passing of the

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
The possibility of an emission of a radiation of such a frequency may
also be interpreted from analogy with the ordinary electrodynamics, as
an electron rotating round a nucleus in an elliptical orbit will emit
a radiation which according to Fourier’s theorem can be resolved into
homogeneous components, the frequencies of which are <span class="nowrap"><img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 2.765ex; height: 1.027ex;" src="images/156.svg" alt=" " data-tex="n \omega">,</span> if
<img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.407ex; height: 1.027ex;" src="images/100.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\omega"> is the frequency of revolution of the electron.</p>

<p>We are thus led to assume that the interpretation of the equation (2)
is not that the different stationary states correspond to an emission
of different numbers of energy-quanta, but that the frequency of the
energy emitted during the passing of the system from a state in which
no energy is yet radiated out to one of the different stationary
states, is equal to different multiples of <img style="vertical-align: -1.552ex; width: 2.403ex; height: 4.084ex;" src="images/157.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\dfrac{\omega}{2}">
where <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.407ex; height: 1.027ex;" src="images/100.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\omega"> is the frequency of revolution of the electron in
the state considered. From this assumption we get exactly the same
expressions as before for the stationary states, and from these by help
of the principal assumptions on <a href="#Page_7">p. 7</a> the same expression for the law
of the hydrogen spectrum. Consequently we may regard our preliminary
considerations on <a href="#Page_5">p. 5</a> only as a simple form of representing the
results of the theory.</p>

<p>Before we leave the discussion of this question, we shall for a moment
return to the question of the significance of the agreement between
the observed and calculated values of the constant entering in the
expressions (4) for the Balmer series of the hydrogen spectrum. From
the above consideration it will follow that, taking the starting-point
in the form of the law of the hydrogen spectrum and assuming that the
different lines correspond to a homogeneous radiation emitted during
the passing between different stationary states, we shall arrive at
exactly the same expression for the constant in question as that given
by (4), if we only assume (1) that the radiation is sent out in quanta
<span class="nowrap"><img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 2.502ex; height: 1.595ex;" src="images/118.svg" alt=" " data-tex="h \nu">,</span> and (2) that the frequency of the radiation emitted during
the passing of the system between successive stationary states will
coincide with the frequency of revolution of the electron in the region
of slow vibrations.</p>

<p>As all the assumptions used in this latter way of representing the
theory are of what we may call a qualitative character, we are
justified in expecting—if the whole way of considering is a sound
one—an absolute agreement between the values calculated and observed
for the constant in question, and not only an approximate agreement.
The formula (4) may therefore be of value in the discussion of the
results of experimental determinations of the constants <span class="nowrap"><img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.054ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/115.svg" alt=" " data-tex="e">,</span> <span class="nowrap"><img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.986ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/105.svg" alt=" " data-tex="m">,</span>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span></p>

<p>While there obviously can be no question of a mechanical foundation of
the calculations given in this paper, it is, however, possible to give
a very simple interpretation of the result of the calculation on <a href="#Page_5">p. 5</a>
by help of symbols taken from the ordinary mechanics. Denoting the
angular momentum of the electron round the nucleus by <span class="nowrap"><img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 2.378ex; height: 1.545ex;" src="images/158.svg" alt=" " data-tex="M">,</span> we have

<img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.407ex; height: 1.027ex;" src="images/100.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\omega"> is the frequency of revolution and <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 1.593ex; height: 1.532ex;" src="images/160.svg" alt=" " data-tex="T"> the kinetic energy

<a href="#Page_3">p. 3</a>) and from (2), <a href="#Page_5">p. 5</a>, we consequently get

\quad M_{0} = \frac{h}{2 \pi } = 1.04 \times 10^{-27}.
"></span></p>

<p>If we therefore assume that the orbit of the electron in the stationary
states is circular, the result of the calculation on <a href="#Page_5">p. 5</a> can be
expressed by the simple condition: that the angular momentum of the
electron round the nucleus in a stationary state of the system is
equal to an entire multiple of a universal value, independent of the
charge on the nucleus. The possible importance of the angular momentum
in the discussion of atomic systems in relation to Planck’s theory is
emphasized by Nicholson<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>.</p>

<p>The great number of different stationary states we do not observe
except by investigation of the emission and absorption of radiation.
In most of the other physical phenomena, however, we only observe the
atoms of the matter in a single distinct state, <i>i. e</i>. the state
of the atoms at low temperature. From the preceding considerations we
are immediately led to the assumption that the “permanent” state is
the one among the stationary states during the formation of which the
greatest amount of energy is emitted. According to the equation (3) on
<a href="#Page_5">p. 5</a>, this state is the one which corresponds to <span class="nowrap"><img style="vertical-align: -0.186ex; width: 5.318ex; height: 1.692ex;" src="images/162.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\tau = 1">.</span></p>


<p class="nindc space-above2 space-below2">
<a id="4">§4. <i>Absorption of Radiation.</i></a></p>


<p>In order to account for Kirchhoff’s law it is necessary to introduce
assumptions on the mechanism of absorption of radiation which
correspond to those we have used considering the emission. Thus we must
assume that a system consisting of a nucleus and an electron rotating
round it under certain circumstances can absorb a radiation of a
frequency equal to the frequency of the homogeneous radiation emitted
during the passing of the system between different stationary states.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>
Let us consider the radiation emitted during the passing of the system
between two stationary states <img style="vertical-align: -0.339ex; width: 2.685ex; height: 1.959ex;" src="images/163.svg" alt=" " data-tex="A_{1}"> and <img style="vertical-align: -0.339ex; width: 2.685ex; height: 1.959ex;" src="images/164.svg" alt=" " data-tex="A_{2}"> corresponding to
values for <img style="vertical-align: -0.029ex; width: 1.17ex; height: 1.005ex;" src="images/109.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\tau"> equal to <img style="vertical-align: -0.339ex; width: 1.976ex; height: 1.314ex;" src="images/120.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\tau_{1}"> and <span class="nowrap"><img style="vertical-align: -0.339ex; width: 1.976ex; height: 1.314ex;" src="images/139.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\tau_{2}">,</span>
<span class="nowrap"><img style="vertical-align: -0.339ex; width: 6.97ex; height: 1.561ex;" src="images/165.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\tau_{1} > \tau_{2}">.</span> As the necessary condition for an emission of
the radiation in question was the presence of systems in the state
<span class="nowrap"><img style="vertical-align: -0.339ex; width: 2.685ex; height: 1.959ex;" src="images/163.svg" alt=" " data-tex="A_{1}">,</span> we must assume that the necessary condition for an
absorption of the radiation is the presence of systems in the state
<span class="nowrap"><img style="vertical-align: -0.339ex; width: 2.685ex; height: 1.959ex;" src="images/164.svg" alt=" " data-tex="A_{2}">.</span></p>

<p>These considerations seem to be in conformity with experiments
on absorption in gases. In hydrogen gas at ordinary conditions
for instance there is no absorption of a radiation of a frequency
corresponding to the line-spectrum of this gas; such an absorption is
only observed in hydrogen gas in a luminous state. This is what we
should expect according to the above. We have on <a href="#Page_9">p. 9</a> assumed that the
radiation in question was emitted during the passing of the systems
between stationary states corresponding to <span class="nowrap"><img style="vertical-align: -0.396ex; width: 5.318ex; height: 2.1ex;" src="images/166.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\tau \geqq 2">.</span> The state
of the atoms in hydrogen gas at ordinary conditions should, however,
correspond to <span class="nowrap"><img style="vertical-align: -0.186ex; width: 5.318ex; height: 1.692ex;" src="images/113.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\tau =1">;</span> furthermore, hydrogen atoms at ordinary
conditions combine into molecules, <i>i. e</i>. into systems in which
the electrons have frequencies different from those in the atoms
(see <a href="#PART_III">Part III</a>.). From the circumstance that certain substances in a
non-luminous state, as, for instance, sodium vapour, absorb radiation
corresponding to lines in the line-spectra of the substances, we may,
on the other hand, conclude that the lines in question are emitted
during the passing of the system between two states, one of which is
the permanent state.</p>

<p>How much the above considerations differ from an interpretation based
on the ordinary electrodynamics is perhaps most clearly shown by the
fact that we have been forced to assume that a system of electrons
will absorb a radiation of a frequency different from the frequency
of vibration of the electrons calculated in the ordinary way. It may
in this connexion be of interest to mention a generalization of the
considerations to which we are led by experiments on the photo-electric
effect, and which may be able to throw some light on the problem in
question. Let us consider a state of the system in which the electron
is free, <i>i. e</i>. in which the electron possesses kinetic energy
sufficient to remove to infinite distances from the nucleus. If we
assume that the motion of the electron is governed by the ordinary
mechanics and that there is no (sensible) energy radiation, the
total energy of the system—as in the above considered stationary
states—will be constant. Further, there will be perfect continuity
between the two kinds of states, as the difference between frequency
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>
and dimensions of the systems in successive stationary states will
diminish without limit if <img style="vertical-align: -0.029ex; width: 1.17ex; height: 1.005ex;" src="images/109.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\tau"> increases. In the following
considerations we shall for the sake of brevity refer to the two kinds
of states in question as “mechanical” states; by this notation only
emphasizing the assumption that the motion of the electron in both
cases can be accounted for by the ordinary mechanics.</p>

<p>Tracing the analogy between the two kinds of mechanical states, we
might now expect the possibility of an absorption of radiation, not
only corresponding to the passing of the system between two different
stationary states, but also corresponding to the passing between one
of the stationary states and a state in which the electron is free;
and as above, we might expect that the frequency of this radiation was
determined by the equation <span class="nowrap"><img style="vertical-align: -0.186ex; width: 7.248ex; height: 1.756ex;" src="images/167.svg" alt=" " data-tex="E = h \nu">,</span> where <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 1.729ex; height: 1.538ex;" src="images/104.svg" alt=" " data-tex="E"> is the difference
between the total energy of the system in the two states. As it will
be seen, such an absorption of radiation is just what is observed in
experiments on ionization by ultra-violet light and by Röntgen rays.
Obviously, we get in this way the same expression for the kinetic
energy of an electron ejected from an atom by photo-electric effect as
that deduced by Einstein<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>, <i>i. e</i>. <span class="nowrap"><img style="vertical-align: -0.186ex; width: 12.249ex; height: 1.756ex;" src="images/168.svg" alt=" " data-tex="T = h \nu - W">,</span> where
<img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 1.593ex; height: 1.532ex;" src="images/160.svg" alt=" " data-tex="T"> is the kinetic energy of the electron ejected, and <img style="vertical-align: -0.05ex; width: 2.371ex; height: 1.595ex;" src="images/102.svg" alt=" " data-tex="W"> the
total amount of energy emitted during the original binding of the
electron.</p>

<p>The above considerations may further account for the result of some
experiments of R. W. Wood<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> on absorption of light by sodium vapour.
In these experiments, an absorption corresponding to a very great
number of lines in the principal series of the sodium spectrum is
observed, and in addition a continuous absorption which begins at the
head of the series and extends to the extreme ultra-violet. This is
exactly what we should expect according to the analogy in question,
and, as we shall see, a closer consideration of the above experiments
allows us to trace the analogy still further. As mentioned on <a href="#Page_9">p. 9</a>
the radii of the orbits of the electrons will for stationary states
corresponding to high values for <img style="vertical-align: -0.029ex; width: 1.17ex; height: 1.005ex;" src="images/109.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\tau"> be very great compared
with ordinary atomic dimensions. This circumstance was used as an
explanation of the non-appearance in experiments with vacuum-tubes
of lines corresponding to the higher numbers in the Balmer series of
the hydrogen spectrum. This is also in conformity with experiments
on the emission spectrum of sodium; in the principal series of the
emission spectrum of this substance rather few lines are observed.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>
Now in Wood’s experiments the pressure was not very low, and the
states corresponding to high values for <img style="vertical-align: -0.029ex; width: 1.17ex; height: 1.005ex;" src="images/109.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\tau"> could therefore not
appear; yet in the absorption spectrum about <img style="vertical-align: -0.05ex; width: 2.262ex; height: 1.557ex;" src="images/169.svg" alt=" " data-tex="50"> lines were detected.
In the experiments in question we consequently observe an absorption
of radiation which is not accompanied by a complete transition between
two different stationary states. According to the present theory
we must assume that this absorption is followed by an emission of
energy during which the systems pass back to the original stationary
state. If there are no collisions between the different systems this
energy will be emitted as a radiation of the same frequency as that
absorbed, and there will be no true absorption but only a scattering
of the original radiation; a true absorption will not occur unless the
energy in question is transformed by collisions into kinetic energy
of free particles. In analogy we may now from the above experiments
conclude that a bound electron—also in cases in which there is
no ionization—will have an absorbing (scattering) influence on a
homogeneous radiation, as soon as the frequency of the radiation is
greater than <span class="nowrap"><img style="vertical-align: -1.577ex; width: 3.367ex; height: 4.652ex;" src="images/170.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\dfrac{W}{h}">,</span> where <img style="vertical-align: -0.05ex; width: 2.371ex; height: 1.595ex;" src="images/102.svg" alt=" " data-tex="W"> is the total amount of
energy emitted during the binding of the electron. This would be highly
in favour of a theory of absorption as the one sketched above, as there
can in such a case be no question of a coincidence of the frequency
of the radiation and a characteristic frequency of vibration of the
electron. It will further be seen that the assumption, that there
will be an absorption (scattering) of any radiation corresponding to
a transition between two different mechanical states, is in perfect
analogy with the assumption generally used that a free electron will
have an absorbing (scattering) influence on light of any frequency.
Corresponding considerations will hold for the emission of radiation.</p>

<p>In analogy to the assumption used in this paper that the emission of
line-spectra is due to the reformation of atoms after one or more
of the lightly bound electrons are removed, we may assume that the
homogeneous Röntgen radiation is emitted during the settling down of
the systems after one of the firmly bound electrons escapes, <i>e.
g</i>. by impact of cathode particles<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>. In the next part of this
paper, dealing with the constitution of atoms, we shall consider
the question more closely and try to show that a calculation based
on this assumption is in quantitative agreement with the results of
experiments: here we shall only mention briefly a problem with which we
meet in such a calculation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span></p>

<p>Experiments on the phenomena of X-rays suggest that not only the
emission and absorption of radiation cannot be treated by the help of
the ordinary electrodynamics, but not even the result, of a collision
between two electrons of which the one is bound in an atom. This is
perhaps most clearly shown by some very instructive calculations on
the energy of <img style="vertical-align: -0.439ex; width: 1.281ex; height: 2.034ex;" src="images/171.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\beta">-particles emitted from radioactive substances
recently published by Rutherford<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>. These calculations strongly
suggest that an electron of great velocity in passing through an atom
and colliding with the electrons bound will loose energy in distinct
finite quanta. As is immediately seen, this is very different from what
we might expect if the result of the collisions was governed by the
usual mechanical laws. The failure of the classical mechanics in such a
problem might also be expected beforehand from the absence of anything
like equipartition of kinetic energy between free electrons and
electrons bound in atoms. From the point of view of the “mechanical”
states we see, however, that the following assumption—which is in
accord with the above analogy—might be able to account for the result
of Rutherford’s calculation and for the absence of equipartition of
kinetic energy: two colliding electrons, bound or free, will, after
the collision as well as before, be in mechanical states. Obviously,
the introduction of such an assumption would not make any alteration
necessary in the classical treatment of a collision between two free
particles. But, considering a collision between a free and a bound
electron, it would follow that the bound electron by the collision
could not acquire a less amount of energy than the difference in energy
corresponding to successive stationary slates, and consequently that
the free electron which collides with it could not lose a less amount.</p>

<p>The preliminary and hypothetical character of the above considerations
needs not to be emphasized. The intention, however, has been to show
that the sketched generalization of the theory of the stationary
states possibly may afford a simple basis of representing a number of
experimental facts which cannot be explained by help of the ordinary
electrodynamics, and that the assumptions used do not seem to be
inconsistent with experiments on phenomena for which a satisfactory
explanation has been given by the classical dynamics and the wave
theory of light.</p>

§5. <i>The permanent State of an Atomic System.</i></p>


<p>We shall now return to the main object of this paper—the discussion
of the “permanent” state of a system consisting of nuclei and bound
electrons. For a system consisting of a nucleus and an electron
rotating round it, this state is, according to the above, determined
by the condition that the angular momentum of the electron round the
nucleus is equal to <span class="nowrap"><img style="vertical-align: -1.577ex; width: 3.416ex; height: 4.676ex;" src="images/172.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\dfrac{h}{2 \pi}">.</span></p>

<p>On the theory of this paper the only neutral atom which contains a
single electron is the hydrogen atom. The permanent state of this atom
should correspond to the values of <img style="vertical-align: -0.023ex; width: 1.197ex; height: 1.02ex;" src="images/106.svg" alt=" " data-tex="a"> and <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.407ex; height: 1.027ex;" src="images/100.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\omega"> calculated on
<a href="#Page_5">p. 5</a>. Unfortunately, however, we know very little of the behaviour
of hydrogen atoms on account of the small dissociation of hydrogen
molecules at ordinary temperatures. In order to get a closer comparison
with experiments, it is necessary to consider more complicated systems.</p>

<p>Considering systems in which more electrons are bound by a positive
nucleus, a configuration of the electrons which presents itself as a
permanent state is one in which the electrons are arranged in a ring
round the nucleus. In the discussion of this problem on the basis
of the ordinary electrodynamics, we meet—apart from the question
of the energy radiation—with new difficulties due to the question
of the stability of the ring. Disregarding for a moment this latter
difficulty, we shall first consider the dimensions and frequency of the
systems in relation to Planck’s theory of radiation.</p>

<p>Let us consider a ring consisting of <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.357ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/155.svg" alt=" " data-tex="n"> electrons rotating round a
nucleus of charge <span class="nowrap"><img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 1.729ex; height: 1.538ex;" src="images/104.svg" alt=" " data-tex="E">,</span> the electrons being arranged at equal angular
intervals around the circumference of a circle of radius <span class="nowrap"><img style="vertical-align: -0.023ex; width: 1.197ex; height: 1.02ex;" src="images/106.svg" alt=" " data-tex="a">.</span></p>

<p>The total potential energy of the system consisting of the electrons
and the nucleus is
<span class="align-center"><img style="vertical-align: -1.575ex; width: 20.408ex; height: 4.104ex;" src="images/22.svg" alt=" " data-tex="
P = -\frac{ne}{a}\,(E - es_{n}),
"></span>
where
<span class="align-center"><img style="vertical-align: -2.819ex; width: 22.494ex; height: 6.712ex;" src="images/23.svg" alt=" " data-tex="
\DeclareMathOperator\cosec{cosec}
s_{n} = \frac{1}{4}\sum_{s=1}^{s=n-1}\cosec \frac{s \pi}{n}.
"></span>
For the radial force exerted on an electron by the nucleus and the
other electrons we get
<span class="align-center"><img style="vertical-align: -1.651ex; width: 31.177ex; height: 4.751ex;" src="images/24.svg" alt=" " data-tex="
F = -\frac{1}{n}\, \frac{dP}{da}
= - \frac{e}{a^{2}} (E - es_{n}).
"></span>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>
Denoting the kinetic energy of an electron by <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 1.593ex; height: 1.532ex;" src="images/160.svg" alt=" " data-tex="T"> and neglecting
the electromagnetic forces due to the motion of the electrons (see
<a href="#PART_II">Part II.</a>), we get, putting the centrifugal force on an electron equal
to the radial force,
<span class="align-center"><img style="vertical-align: -1.651ex; width: 20.441ex; height: 4.713ex;" src="images/25.svg" alt=" " data-tex="
\frac{2T}{a} = \frac{e}{a^{2}}\,(E - es_{n}),
"></span>
or
<span class="align-center"><img style="vertical-align: -1.575ex; width: 18.458ex; height: 4.104ex;" src="images/26.svg" alt=" " data-tex="
T = \frac{e}{2a}\,(E - es_{n}).
"></span>
From this we get for the frequency of revolution
<span class="align-center"><img style="vertical-align: -2.307ex; width: 22.344ex; height: 6.923ex;" src="images/27.svg" alt=" " data-tex="
\omega = \frac{1}{2 \pi} \sqrt{\frac{e(E- es_{n})}{ma^{3}}}.
"></span>
The total amount of energy <img style="vertical-align: -0.05ex; width: 2.371ex; height: 1.595ex;" src="images/102.svg" alt=" " data-tex="W"> necessary transferred to the system
in order to remove the electrons to infinite distances apart from the
nucleus and from each other is
<span class="align-center"><img style="vertical-align: -1.575ex; width: 37.479ex; height: 4.104ex;" src="images/28.svg" alt=" " data-tex="
W= -P - nT = \frac{ne}{2a}\,(E - es_{n}) = nT,
"></span>
equal to the total kinetic energy of the electrons.</p>

<p>We see that the only difference in the above formula and those holding
for the motion of a single electron in a circular orbit round a nucleus
is the exchange of <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 1.729ex; height: 1.538ex;" src="images/104.svg" alt=" " data-tex="E"> for <span class="nowrap"><img style="vertical-align: -0.357ex; width: 7.757ex; height: 1.895ex;" src="images/173.svg" alt=" " data-tex="E - es_{n}">.</span> It is also immediately
seen that corresponding to the motion of an electron in an elliptical
orbit round a nucleus, there will be a motion of the <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.357ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/155.svg" alt=" " data-tex="n"> electrons
in which each rotates in an elliptical orbit with the nucleus in the
focus, and the <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.357ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/155.svg" alt=" " data-tex="n"> electrons at any moment are situated at equal
angular intervals on a circle with the nucleus as the centre. The major
axis and frequency of the orbit of the single electrons will for this
motion be given by the expressions (1) on <a href="#Page_3">p. 3</a> if we replace <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 1.729ex; height: 1.538ex;" src="images/104.svg" alt=" " data-tex="E"> by
<img style="vertical-align: -0.357ex; width: 7.757ex; height: 1.895ex;" src="images/173.svg" alt=" " data-tex="E - es_{n}"> and <img style="vertical-align: -0.05ex; width: 2.371ex; height: 1.595ex;" src="images/102.svg" alt=" " data-tex="W"> by <span class="nowrap"><img style="vertical-align: -1.577ex; width: 3.367ex; height: 4.652ex;" src="images/174.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\dfrac{W}{n}">.</span> Let us now suppose that
the system of <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.357ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/155.svg" alt=" " data-tex="n"> electrons rotating in a ring round a nucleus is
formed in a way analogous to the one assumed for a single electron
rotating round a nucleus. It will thus be assumed that the electrons,
before the binding by the nucleus, were at a great distance apart from
the latter and possessed no sensible velocities, and also that during
the binding a homogeneous radiation is emitted. As in the case of a
single electron, we have here that the total amount of energy emitted
during the formation of the system is equal to the final kinetic energy
of the electrons. If we now suppose that during the formation of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>
the system the electrons at any moment are situated at equal angular
intervals on the circumference of a circle with the nucleus in the
centre, from analogy with the considerations on <a href="#Page_5">p. 5</a> we are here led to
assume the existence of a series of stationary configurations in which
the kinetic energy per electron is equal to <span class="nowrap"><img style="vertical-align: -1.552ex; width: 4.876ex; height: 4.084ex;" src="images/175.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\tau h \dfrac{\omega}{2}">,</span>
where <img style="vertical-align: -0.029ex; width: 1.17ex; height: 1.005ex;" src="images/109.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\tau"> is an entire number, <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.303ex; height: 1.595ex;" src="images/110.svg" alt=" " data-tex="h"> Planck’s constant, and
<img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.407ex; height: 1.027ex;" src="images/100.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\omega"> the frequency of revolution. The configuration in which the
greatest amount of energy is emitted is, as before, the one in which
<span class="nowrap"><img style="vertical-align: -0.186ex; width: 5.318ex; height: 1.692ex;" src="images/162.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\tau = 1">.</span> This configuration we shall assume to be the permanent
state of the system if the electrons in this state are arranged in
a single ring. As for the case of a single electron we get that the
angular momentum of each of the electrons is equal to <span class="nowrap"><img style="vertical-align: -1.577ex; width: 3.416ex; height: 4.676ex;" src="images/172.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\dfrac{h}{2 \pi}">.</span>
It may be remarked that instead of considering the single
electrons we might have considered the ring as an entity. This would,
however, lead to the same result, for in this case the frequency of
revolution <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.407ex; height: 1.027ex;" src="images/100.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\omega"> will be replaced by the frequency <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 2.765ex; height: 1.027ex;" src="images/156.svg" alt=" " data-tex="n \omega">
of the radiation from the whole ring calculated from the ordinary
electrodynamics, and <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 1.593ex; height: 1.532ex;" src="images/160.svg" alt=" " data-tex="T"> by the total kinetic energy <span class="nowrap"><img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 2.95ex; height: 1.557ex;" src="images/176.svg" alt=" " data-tex="nT">.</span></p>

<p>There may be many other stationary states corresponding to other ways
of forming the system. The assumption of the existence of such states
seems necessary in order to account for the line-spectra of systems
containing more than one electron (<a href="#Page_11">p. 11</a>); it is also suggested by
the theory of Nicholson mentioned on <a href="#Page_6">p. 6</a>, to which we shall return
in a moment. The consideration of the spectra, however, gives, as far
as I can see, no indication of the existence of stationary states in
which all the electrons are arranged in a ring and which correspond to
greater values for the total energy emitted than the one we above have
assumed to be the permanent state.</p>

<p>Further, there may be stationary configurations of a system of <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.357ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/155.svg" alt=" " data-tex="n">
electrons and a nucleus of charge <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 1.729ex; height: 1.538ex;" src="images/104.svg" alt=" " data-tex="E"> in which all the electrons
are not arranged in a single ring. The question, however, of the
existence of such stationary configurations is not essential for our
determination of the permanent state, as long as we assume that the
electrons in this state of the system are arranged in a single ring.
Systems corresponding to more complicated configurations will be
discussed on <a href="#Page_24">p. 24</a>.</p>

<p>Using the relation <img style="vertical-align: -1.552ex; width: 8.316ex; height: 4.084ex;" src="images/177.svg" alt=" " data-tex="T = h \dfrac{\omega}{2}"> we get, by help of
the above expressions for <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 1.593ex; height: 1.532ex;" src="images/160.svg" alt=" " data-tex="T"> and <span class="nowrap"><img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.407ex; height: 1.027ex;" src="images/100.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\omega">,</span> values for <img style="vertical-align: -0.023ex; width: 1.197ex; height: 1.02ex;" src="images/106.svg" alt=" " data-tex="a"> and
<img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.407ex; height: 1.027ex;" src="images/100.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\omega"> corresponding to the permanent state of the system which
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>
only differ from those given by the equations (3) on <a href="#Page_5">p. 5</a>, by exchange
of <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 1.729ex; height: 1.538ex;" src="images/104.svg" alt=" " data-tex="E"> for <span class="nowrap"><img style="vertical-align: -0.357ex; width: 7.757ex; height: 1.895ex;" src="images/173.svg" alt=" " data-tex="E - es_{n}">.</span></p>

<p>The question of stability of a ring of electrons rotating round a
positive charge is discussed in great detail by Sir J. J. Thomson<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>.
An adaption of Thomson’s analysis for the case here considered of a
ring rotating round a nucleus of negligibly small linear dimensions is
given by Nicholson<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>. The investigation of the problem in question
naturally divides in two parts: one concerning the stability for
displacements of the electrons in the plane of the ring; one concerning
displacements perpendicular to this plane. As Nicholson’s calculations
show, the answer to the question of stability differs very much in the
two cases in question. While the ring for the latter displacements in
general is stable if the number of electrons is not great; the ring
is in no case considered by Nicholson stable for displacements of the
first kind.</p>

<p>According, however, to the point of view taken in this paper, the
question of stability for displacements of the electrons in the plane
of the ring is most intimately connected with the question of the
mechanism of the binding of the electrons, and like the latter cannot
be treated on the basis of the ordinary dynamics. The hypothesis of
which we shall make use in the following is that the stability of a
ring of electrons rotating round a nucleus is secured through the above
condition of the universal constancy of the angular momentum, together
with the further condition that the configuration of the particles is
the one by the formation of which the greatest amount of energy is
emitted. As will be shown, this hypothesis is, concerning the question
of stability for a displacement of the electrons perpendicular to the
plane of the ring, equivalent to that used in ordinary mechanical
calculations.</p>

<p>Returning to the theory of Nicholson on the origin of lines observed
in the spectrum of the solar corona, we shall now see that the
difficulties mentioned on <a href="#Page_7">p. 7</a> may be only formal. In the first
place, from the point of view considered above the objection as to
the instability of the systems for displacements of the electrons in
the plane of the ring may not be valid. Further, the objection as
to the emission of the radiation in quanta will not have reference
to the calculations in question, if we assume that in the coronal
spectrum we are not dealing with a true emission but only with a
scattering of radiation. This assumption seems probable if we consider
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>
the conditions in the celestial body in question; for on account of
the enormous rarefaction of the matter there may be comparatively
few collisions to disturb the stationary states and to cause a true
emission of light corresponding to the transition between different
stationary states; on the other hand there will in the solar corona be
intense illumination of light of all frequencies which may excite the
natural vibrations of the systems in the different stationary states.
If the above assumption is correct, we immediately understand the
entirely different form for the laws connecting the lines discussed by
Nicholson and those connecting the ordinary line-spectra considered in
this paper.</p>

<p class= "space-above2">
Proceeding to consider systems of a more complicated constitution,
we shall make use of the following theorem, which can be very simply
proved:—</p>

<p>“In every system consisting of electrons and positive nuclei, in which
the nuclei are at rest and the electrons move in circular orbits with a
velocity small compared with the velocity of light, the kinetic energy
will be numerically equal to half the potential energy.”</p>

<p>By help of this theorem we get—as in the previous cases of a single
electron or of a ring rotating round a nucleus—that the total amount
of energy emitted, by the formation of the systems from a configuration
in which the distances apart of the particles are infinitely great and
in which the particles have no velocities relative to each other, is
equal to the kinetic energy of the electrons in the final configuration.</p>

<p>In analogy with the case of a single ring we are here led to assume
that corresponding to any configuration of equilibrium a series of
geometrically similar, stationary configurations of the system will
exist in which the kinetic energy of every electron is equal to the
frequency of revolution multiplied by <img style="vertical-align: -1.552ex; width: 3.468ex; height: 4.057ex;" src="images/178.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\dfrac{\tau}{2}h"> where
<img style="vertical-align: -0.029ex; width: 1.17ex; height: 1.005ex;" src="images/109.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\tau"> is an entire number and <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.303ex; height: 1.595ex;" src="images/110.svg" alt=" " data-tex="h"> Planck’s constant. In any such
series of stationary configurations the one corresponding to the
greatest amount of energy emitted will be the one in which <img style="vertical-align: -0.029ex; width: 1.17ex; height: 1.005ex;" src="images/109.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\tau"> for
every electron is equal to <span class="nowrap"><img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 1.131ex; height: 1.507ex;" src="images/112.svg" alt=" " data-tex="1">.</span> Considering that the ratio of kinetic
energy to frequency for a particle rotating in a circular orbit is
equal to <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.29ex; height: 1ex;" src="images/179.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\pi"> times the angular momentum round the centre of the
orbit, we are therefore led to the following simple generalization of
the hypotheses mentioned on p<a href="#Page_15">p. 15</a> and <a href="#Page_22">22</a>.</p>

<p>“<i>In any molecular system consisting of positive nuclei and
electrons in which the nuclei are at rest relative to each other and
the electrons move in circular orbits, the angular momentum of every
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>
electron round the centre of its orbit will in the permanent state of
the system be equal to <span class="nowrap"><img style="vertical-align: -1.577ex; width: 3.416ex; height: 4.676ex;" src="images/172.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\dfrac{h}{2 \pi}">,</span> where <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.303ex; height: 1.595ex;" src="images/110.svg" alt=" " data-tex="h"> is Planck’s
constant”</i><a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>.</p>

<p>In analogy with the considerations on <a href="#Page_23">p. 23</a>, we shall assume that a
configuration satisfying this condition is stable if the total energy
of the system is less than in any neighbouring configuration satisfying
the same condition of the angular momentum of the electrons.</p>

<p>As mentioned in the introduction, the above hypothesis will be used in
a following communication as a basis for a theory of the constitution
of atoms and molecules. It will be shown that it leads to results which
seem to be in conformity with experiments on a number of different
phenomena.</p>

<p>The foundation of the hypothesis has been sought entirely in its
relation with Planck’s theory of radiation; by help of considerations
given later it will be attempted to throw some further light on the
foundation of it from another point of view.</p>

<p class="nind">
FOLLOWING the theory of Rutherford, we shall assume that the atoms of
the elements consist of a positively charged nucleus surrounded by a
cluster of electrons. The nucleus is the seat of the essential part
of the mass of the atom, and has linear dimensions exceedingly small
compared with the distances apart of the electrons in the surrounding
cluster.</p>

<p>As in the previous paper, we shall assume that the cluster of electrons
is formed by the successive binding by the nucleus of electrons
initially nearly at rest, energy at the same time being radiated away.
This will go on until, when the total negative charge on the bound
electrons is numerically equal to the positive charge on the nucleus,
the system will be neutral and no longer able to exert sensible forces
on electrons at distances from the nucleus great in comparison with
the dimensions of the orbits of the bound electrons. We may regard
the formation of helium from <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.448ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/99.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\alpha"> rays as an observed example
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>
of a process of this kind, an <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.448ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/99.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\alpha"> particle on this view being
identical with the nucleus of a helium atom.</p>

<p>On account of the small dimensions of the nucleus, its internal
structure will not be of sensible influence on the constitution of
the cluster of electrons, and consequently will have no effect on the
ordinary physical and chemical properties of the atom. The latter
properties on this theory will depend entirely on the total charge and
mass of the nucleus; the internal structure of the nucleus will be of
influence only on the phenomena of radioactivity.</p>

<p>From the result of experiments on large-angle scattering of
<img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.448ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/99.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\alpha">-rays, Rutherford<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> found an electric charge on the nucleus
corresponding per atom to a number of electrons approximately equal to
half the atomic weight. This result seems to be in agreement with the
number of electrons per atom calculated from experiments on scattering
of Röntgen radiation<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a>. The total experimental evidence supports
the hypothesis<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> that the actual number of electrons in a neutral
atom with a few exceptions is equal to the number which indicates
the position of the corresponding element in the series of elements
arranged in order of increasing atomic weight. For example on this
view, the atom of oxygen which is the eighth element of the series has
eight electrons and a nucleus carrying eight unit charges.</p>

<p>We shall assume that the electrons are arranged at equal angular
intervals in coaxial rings rotating round the nucleus. In order to
determine the frequency and dimensions of the rings we shall use the
main hypothesis of the first paper, viz.: that in the permanent state
of an atom the angular momentum of every electron round the centre of
its orbit is equal to the universal value where <span class="nowrap"><img style="vertical-align: -1.577ex; width: 3.416ex; height: 4.676ex;" src="images/172.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\dfrac{h}{2 \pi}">,</span>
where <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.303ex; height: 1.595ex;" src="images/110.svg" alt=" " data-tex="h"> is Planck’s constant. We shall take as a condition of
stability, that the total energy of the system in the configuration in
question is less than in any neighbouring configuration satisfying the
same condition of the angular momentum of the electrons.</p>

<p>If the charge on the nucleus and the number of electrons in the
different rings is known, the condition in regard to the angular
momentum of the electrons will, as shown in <a href="#2_1">§2</a>, completely determine
the configuration of the system, <i>i. e.</i>, the frequency of
revolution and the linear dimensions of the rings. Corresponding to
different distributions of the electrons in the rings, however, there
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>
will, in general, be more than one configuration which will satisfy
the condition of the angular momentum together with the condition of
stability.</p>

<p>In <a href="#3_1">§3</a> and <a href="#4_1">§4</a> it will be shown that, on the general view of the
formation of the atoms, we are led to indications of the arrangement of
the electrons in the rings which are consistent with those suggested by
the chemical properties of the corresponding element.</p>

<p>In <a href="#5_1">§5</a> it will be shown that it is possible from the theory to calculate
the minimum velocity of cathode rays necessary to produce the
characteristic Röntgen radiation from the element, and that this is in
approximate agreement with the experimental values.</p>

<p>In §6 the phenomena of radioactivity will be briefly considered in
relation to the theory.</p>

<p>Let us consider an electron of charge <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.054ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/115.svg" alt=" " data-tex="e"> and mass <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.986ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/105.svg" alt=" " data-tex="m"> which

<p>Introducing the condition of universal constancy of the angular

total amount of energy emitted during the formation of the system from
an original configuration in which all the particles are at rest and

by W, we consequently get

<p>In neglecting the magnetic forces due to the motion of the electrons we
have in <a href="#PART_I">Part I.</a> assumed that the velocities of the particles are small
compared with the velocity of light. The above calculations show that
for this to hold, <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 1.695ex; height: 1.538ex;" src="images/182.svg" alt=" " data-tex="F"> must be small compared with <span class="nowrap"><img style="vertical-align: -0.05ex; width: 3.394ex; height: 1.557ex;" src="images/190.svg" alt=" " data-tex="150">.</span> As will be
seen, the latter condition will be satisfied for all the electrons in
the atoms of elements of low atomic weight and for a greater part of
the electrons contained in the atoms of the other elements.</p>

<p>If the velocity of the electrons is not small compared with the
velocity of light, the constancy of the angular momentum no longer
involves a constant ratio between the energy and the frequency of
revolution. Without introducing new assumptions, we cannot therefore
in this case determine the configuration of the systems on the basis
of the considerations in <a href="#PART_I">Part I</a>. Considerations given later suggest,
however, that the constancy of the angular momentum is the principal
condition. Applying this condition for velocities not small compared
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>
with the velocity of light, we get the same expression for <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.097ex; height: 1.027ex;" src="images/180.svg" alt=" " data-tex="v">
as that given by (1), while the quantity <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.986ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/105.svg" alt=" " data-tex="m"> in the expressions

"></span></p>

<p>As stated in <a href="#PART_I">Part I.</a>, a calculation based on the ordinary mechanics
gives the result, that a ring of electrons rotating round a positive
nucleus in general is unstable for displacements of the electrons in
the plane of the ring. In order to escape from this difficulty, we have
assumed that the ordinary principles of mechanics cannot be used in the
discussion of the problem in question, any more than in the discussion
of the connected problem of the mechanism of binding of electrons. We
have also assumed that the stability for such displacements is secured
through the introduction of the hypothesis of the universal constancy
of the angular momentum of the electrons.</p>

<p>As is easily shown, the latter assumption is included in the condition
of stability in <a href="#1_1">§1</a>. Consider a ring of electrons rotating round a
nucleus, and assume that the system is in dynamical equilibrium and
that the radius of the ring is <span class="nowrap"><img style="vertical-align: -0.375ex; width: 2.185ex; height: 1.372ex;" src="images/192.svg" alt=" " data-tex="a_{0}">,</span> the velocity of the electrons
<img style="vertical-align: -0.375ex; width: 2.085ex; height: 1.377ex;" src="images/193.svg" alt=" " data-tex="v_{0}"> the total kinetic energy <span class="nowrap"><img style="vertical-align: -0.375ex; width: 2.309ex; height: 1.906ex;" src="images/194.svg" alt=" " data-tex="T_{0}">,</span> and the potential energy
<span class="nowrap"><img style="vertical-align: -0.375ex; width: 2.44ex; height: 1.92ex;" src="images/195.svg" alt=" " data-tex="P_{0}">.</span> As shown in Part I. (<a href="#Page_21">p. 21</a>)
we have <span class="nowrap"><img style="vertical-align: -0.375ex; width: 10.658ex; height: 1.92ex;" src="images/196.svg" alt=" " data-tex="P_{0} = - 2T_{0}">.</span>
Next consider a configuration of the system in which the electrons,
under influence of extraneous forces, rotate with the same angular
momentum round the nucleus in a ring of radius <span class="nowrap"><img style="vertical-align: -0.375ex; width: 7.846ex; height: 1.694ex;" src="images/197.svg" alt=" " data-tex="a = \alpha a_{0}">.</span>
In this case we have <span class="nowrap"><img style="vertical-align: -1.577ex; width: 9.6ex; height: 4.613ex;" src="images/198.svg" alt=" " data-tex="P= \dfrac{1}{\alpha}P_{0}">,</span> and on account of
the uniformity of the angular momentum <img style="vertical-align: -1.577ex; width: 8.643ex; height: 4.613ex;" src="images/199.svg" alt=" " data-tex="v= \dfrac{1}{\alpha}v_{0}">
and <span class="nowrap"><img style="vertical-align: -1.654ex; width: 10.481ex; height: 4.69ex;" src="images/200.svg" alt=" " data-tex=" T= \dfrac{1}{\alpha^{2}}P_{0}">.</span> Using the relation
<span class="nowrap"><img style="vertical-align: -0.375ex; width: 10.658ex; height: 1.92ex;" src="images/196.svg" alt=" " data-tex="P_{0} = - 2T_{0}">,</span> we get
<span class="align-center"><img style="vertical-align: -2.148ex; width: 49.489ex; height: 5.876ex;" src="images/37.svg" alt=" " data-tex="
P + T = \frac{1}{\alpha}P_{0} + \frac{1}{\alpha^{2}}P_{0}
= P_{0} + T_{0} + T_{0}\left(1 - \frac{1}{\alpha}\right)^{2}.
"></span>
We see that the total energy of the new configuration is greater than
in the original. According to the condition of stability in <a href="#1_1">§1</a> the
system is consequently stable for the displacement considered. In this
connexion, it may be remarked that in <a href="#PART_I">Part I.</a> we have assumed that the
frequency of radiation emitted or absorbed by the systems cannot be
determined from the frequencies of vibration of the electrons, in the
plane of the orbits, calculated by help of the ordinary mechanics.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>
We have, on the contrary, assumed that the frequency of the radiation
is determined by the condition <span class="nowrap"><img style="vertical-align: -0.186ex; width: 7.248ex; height: 1.756ex;" src="images/201.svg" alt=" " data-tex="h \nu = E">,</span> where <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 1.199ex; height: 1ex;" src="images/107.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\nu"> is the

corresponding to two different “stationary” states of the system.</p>

<p>In considering the stability of a ring of electrons rotating round
a nucleus for displacements of the electrons perpendicular to the

the electrons are displaced by <span class="nowrap"><img style="vertical-align: -0.339ex; width: 3.044ex; height: 1.962ex;" src="images/202.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\delta z_{1}">,</span> <span class="nowrap"><img style="vertical-align: -0.339ex; width: 3.044ex; height: 1.962ex;" src="images/202.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\delta z_{1}">,</span>....

has its smallest value. This condition is identical with the condition
of stability for displacements of the electrons perpendicular to
the plane of the ring, deduced by help of ordinary mechanical
considerations<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>.</p>

<p>A suggestive illustration is obtained by imagining that the
displacements considered are produced by the effect of extraneous
forces acting on the electrons in a direction parallel to the axis
of the ring. If the displacements are produced infinitely slowly
the motion of the electrons will at any moment be parallel to the
original plane of the ring, and the angular momentum of each of the
electrons round the centre of its orbit will obviously be equal to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>
its original value; the increase in the potential energy of the system
will be equal to the work done by the extraneous forces during the
displacements. From such considerations we are led to assume that the
ordinary mechanics can be used in calculating the vibrations of the
electrons perpendicular to the plane of the ring—contrary to the case
of vibrations in the plane of the ring. This assumption is supported by
the apparent agreement with observations obtained by Nicholson in his
theory of the origin of lines in the spectra of the solar corona and
stellar nebulæ (see Part I. p<a href="#Page_6">p. 6</a>
&amp; <a href="#Page_23">23</a>). In addition it will be shown
later that the assumption seems to be in agreement with experiments on
dispersion.</p>

<p>We see from the table that the number of electrons which can rotate
in a single ring round a nucleus of charge <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 3.063ex; height: 1.57ex;" src="images/183.svg" alt=" " data-tex="Ne"> increases only very

We see, further, that a ring of <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.357ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/155.svg" alt=" " data-tex="n"> electrons cannot rotate in a

<p>In the above we have supposed that the electrons move under the
influence of a stationary radial force and that their orbits are
exactly circular. The first condition will not be satisfied if we
consider a system containing several rings of electrons which rotate
with different frequencies. If, however, the distance between the rings
is not small in comparison with their radii, and if the ratio between
their frequencies is not near to unity, the deviation from circular
orbits may be very small and the motion of the electrons to a close
approximation may be identical with that obtained on the assumption
that the charge on the electrons is uniformly distributed along the
circumference of the rings. If the ratio between the radii of the rings
is not near to unity, the conditions of stability obtained on this
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>
assumption may also be considered as sufficient.</p>

<p>We have assumed in <a href="#1_1">§1</a> that the electrons in the atoms rotate in coaxial
rings. The calculation indicates that only in the case of systems
containing a great number of electrons will the planes of the rings
separate; in the case of systems containing a moderate number of
electrons, all the rings will be situated in a single plane through the
nucleus. For the sake of brevity, we shall therefore here only consider
the latter case.</p>

<p>Let us consider an electric charge <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 1.729ex; height: 1.538ex;" src="images/104.svg" alt=" " data-tex="E"> uniformly distributed along

electrons which rotate in the same plane round a nucleus of charge

"></span>
the summation is to be taken over all the rings except the one
considered.</p>

<p>If we know the distribution of the electrons in the different rings,
from the relation (1) on <a href="#Page_28">p. 28</a>, we can, by help of the above,
determine <span class="nowrap"><img style="vertical-align: -0.339ex; width: 2.185ex; height: 1.337ex;" src="images/218.svg" alt=" " data-tex="a_{1}">,</span> <span class="nowrap"><img style="vertical-align: -0.339ex; width: 2.185ex; height: 1.337ex;" src="images/219.svg" alt=" " data-tex="a_{2}">,</span> .... The calculation can be made
by successive approximations, starting from a set of values for
the <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.448ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/99.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\alpha">’s, and from them calculating the <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 1.695ex; height: 1.538ex;" src="images/182.svg" alt=" " data-tex="F">’s, and then
redetermining the <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.448ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/99.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\alpha">’s by the relation (1) which gives
<span class="nowrap"><img style="vertical-align: -1.909ex; width: 22.122ex; height: 4.977ex;" src="images/224.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\dfrac{F_{s}}{F_{r}} = \dfrac{a_{r}}{a_{s}} = \text{tan}^{2} (\alpha_{r,s})">,</span>
and so on.</p>

<p>As in the case of a single ring it is supposed that the systems are
stable for displacements of the electrons in the plane of their orbits.
In a calculation such as that on <a href="#Page_30">p. 30.</a>, the interaction of the rings
ought strictly to be taken into account. This interaction will involve
that the quantities <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 1.695ex; height: 1.538ex;" src="images/182.svg" alt=" " data-tex="F"> are not constant, as for a single ring
rotating round a nucleus, but will vary with the radii of the rings;
the variation in <span class="nowrap"><img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 1.695ex; height: 1.538ex;" src="images/182.svg" alt=" " data-tex="F">,</span> however, if the ratio between the radii of the
rings is not very near to unity, will be too small to be of influence
on the result of the calculation.</p>

<p>Considering the stability of the systems for a displacement of the
electrons perpendicular to the plane of the rings, it is necessary to
distinguish between displacements in which the centres of gravity of
the electrons in the single rings are unaltered, and displacements
in which all the electrons inside the same ring are displaced in the
same direction. The condition of stability for the first kind of
displacements is given by the condition (5) on <a href="#Page_31">p. 31.</a>, if for every
ring we replace <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 2.009ex; height: 1.545ex;" src="images/151.svg" alt=" " data-tex="N"> by a quantity <span class="nowrap"><img style="vertical-align: -0.05ex; width: 1.778ex; height: 1.645ex;" src="images/225.svg" alt=" " data-tex="G">,</span> determined by the condition
that <img style="vertical-align: -2.204ex; width: 7.924ex; height: 5.62ex;" src="images/226.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\dfrac{e^{2}}{a_r^{3}}G_{r}\delta z"> is equal to the component
perpendicular to the plane of the ring of the force—due to the nucleus
and the electrons in the other rings—acting on one of the electrons
if it has received a small displacement <span class="nowrap"><img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 2.057ex; height: 1.647ex;" src="images/216.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\delta z">.</span> Using the same
notation as above, we get
<span class="align-center"><img style="vertical-align: -1.018ex; width: 24.078ex; height: 3.167ex;" src="images/48.svg" alt=" " data-tex="
G_{r} = N - \sum n_{s}R(\alpha_{r,s}).
"></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span></p>

<p>If all the electrons in one of the rings are displaced in the same
direction by help of extraneous forces, the displacement will
produce corresponding displacements of the electrons in the other
rings; and this interaction will be of influence on the stability.
For example, consider a system of <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.986ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/105.svg" alt=" " data-tex="m"> concentric rings rotating
in a plane round a nucleus of charge <span class="nowrap"><img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 3.063ex; height: 1.57ex;" src="images/183.svg" alt=" " data-tex="Ne">,</span> and let us assume that
the electrons in the different rings are displaced perpendicular
to the plane by <span class="nowrap"><img style="vertical-align: -0.339ex; width: 3.044ex; height: 1.962ex;" src="images/202.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\delta z_{1}">,</span> <span class="nowrap"><img style="vertical-align: -0.339ex; width: 3.044ex; height: 1.962ex;" src="images/227.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\delta z_{2}">,</span>.... <img style="vertical-align: -0.357ex; width: 3.649ex; height: 1.979ex;" src="images/228.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\delta z_{m}">
respectively. With the above notation the increase in the
potential energy of the system is given by
<span class="align-center"><img style="vertical-align: -2.204ex; width: 58.91ex; height: 5.62ex;" src="images/49.svg" alt=" " data-tex="
\frac{1}{2}N\sum n_{r} \frac{e^{2}}{a_n^{3}}(\delta z_{r})^{2}
- \frac{1}{4}\sum\sum n_{r}n_{s}\frac{e^{2}}{a_r^{3}}R(\alpha_{r,s})
(\delta z_{r} - \delta z_{s})^{2}.
"></span>
The condition of stability is that this expression is positive for
arbitrary values of <span class="nowrap"><img style="vertical-align: -0.339ex; width: 3.044ex; height: 1.962ex;" src="images/202.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\delta z_{1}">,</span>.... <span class="nowrap"><img style="vertical-align: -0.357ex; width: 3.649ex; height: 1.979ex;" src="images/228.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\delta z_{m}">.</span> This
condition can be worked out simply in the usual way. It is not of
sensible influence compared with the condition of stability for the
displacements considered above, except in cases where the system
contains several rings of few electrons.</p>

the dimensions—is small, but that unless the ratio between the radii
is very great, the effect of inner rings on the stability of outer is
considerably greater than to neutralize a corresponding part of the

<p>The maximum number of electrons which the innermost ring can contain
without being unstable is approximately equal to that calculated on <a href="#Page_32">p. 32.</a>
for a single ring rotating round a nucleus. For the outer rings,
however, we get considerably smaller numbers than those determined
by the condition (5) if we replace <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 3.063ex; height: 1.57ex;" src="images/183.svg" alt=" " data-tex="Ne"> by the total charge on the

<p>If a system of rings rotating round a nucleus in a single-plane is
stable for small displacements of the electrons perpendicular to this
plane, there will in general be no stable configurations of the rings,
satisfying the condition of the constancy of the angular momentum of
the electrons, in which all the rings are not situated in the plane.
An exception occurs in the special case of two rings containing equal
numbers of electrons; in this case there may be a stable configuration
in which the two rings have equal radii and rotate in parallel planes
at equal distances from the nucleus, the electrons in the one ring
being situated just opposite the intervals between the electrons in
the other ring. The latter configuration, however, is unstable if the
configuration in which all the electrons in the two rings are arranged
in a single ring is stable.</p>

<p>As stated in <a href="#1_1">§1</a>, the condition of the universal constancy of the
angular momentum of the electrons, together with the condition of
stability, is in most cases not sufficient to determine completely the
constitution of the system. On the general view of formation of atoms,
however, and by making use of the knowledge of the properties of the
corresponding elements, it will be attempted, in this section and the
next, to obtain indications of what configurations of the electrons may
be expected to occur in the atoms. In these considerations we shall
assume that the number of electrons in the atom is equal to the number
which indicates the position of the corresponding element in the series
of elements arranged in order of increasing atomic weight. Exceptions

therefore assume the existence of a series of stationary states in
which the electron most lightly bound moves approximately in the same
way as the electron in the stationary states of a hydrogen atom.
Such an assumption has already been used in <a href="#PART_I">Part I</a>. in an attempt
to explain the appearance of Rydberg’s constant in the formula for
the line-spectrum of any element. We can, however, hardly assume the
existence of a stable configuration in which the two electrons have the
same angular momentum round the nucleus and move in different orbits,
the one outside the other. In such a configuration the electrons would
be so near to each other that the deviations from circular orbits would
be very great. For the permanent state of a neutral helium atom, we
shall therefore adopt the configuration

The fact that the latter frequency is great compared with that observed
might explain that the number of electrons in a helium atom, calculated
by help of Drude’s theory from the experiments on dispersion,
is only about two-thirds of the number to be expected. (Using

in the spectra of certain stars, which show the Pickering spectrum

to a close approximation can be expressed by the formula

From analogy with the Balmer- and Pickering-spectra, Nicholson has
suggested that the lines in question are due to hydrogen.</p>

<p>For the permanent state of a lithium atom with two positive charges
we get a configuration
<span class="align-center"><img style="vertical-align: -1.602ex; width: 42.306ex; height: 4.638ex;" src="images/61.svg" alt=" " data-tex="

a = \frac{1}{3}\, a_{0}, \quad
\omega = 9\, \omega_{0}, \quad

"></span></p>

<p>The probability of a permanent configuration in which two electrons
move in different orbits around each other must for lithium be
considered still less probable than for helium, as the ratio between
the radii of the orbits would be still nearer to unity. For a lithium
atom with a single positive charge we shall, therefore, adopt the
configuration:
<span class="align-center"><img style="vertical-align: -0.8ex; width: 52.247ex; height: 2.345ex;" src="images/62.svg" alt=" " data-tex="

electrons in a lithium atom are very strongly bound compared with the
electron in a hydrogen atom; they are still more rigidly bound than the
electrons in a helium atom.</p>

<p>From a consideration of the chemical properties we should expect the
following configuration for the electrons in a neutral lithium atom:
<span class="align-center"><img style="vertical-align: -0.8ex; width: 38.156ex; height: 2.329ex;" src="images/63.svg" alt=" " data-tex="

a_{2} = 1.182\, a_{0}, \quad

<p>This configuration may be considered as highly probable also from a
dynamical point of view. The deviation of the outermost electron from
a circular orbit will be very small, partly on account of the great
values of the ratio between the radii, and of the ratio between the
frequencies of the orbits of the inner and outer electrons, partly
also on account of the symmetrical arrangement of the inner electrons.
Accordingly, it appears probable that the three electrons will not
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>
arrange themselves in a single ring and form the system:

the electron in a hydrogen atom. The difference in the firmness of the
binding corresponds to a difference of <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 7.995ex; height: 1.595ex;" src="images/273.svg" alt=" " data-tex="1.4\,\text{volts}"> in the ionization
potential. A marked difference between the electron in hydrogen and
the outermost electron in lithium lies also in the greater tendency
of the latter electron to leave the plane of the orbits. The quantity
<img style="vertical-align: -0.05ex; width: 1.778ex; height: 1.645ex;" src="images/225.svg" alt=" " data-tex="G"> considered in <a href="#2_1">§2</a>, which gives a kind of measure for the stability

<p class="nindc space-above2 space-below2">
<a id="4_1">§4. <i>Atoms containing greater numbers of electrons.</i></a></p>


<p>From the examples discussed in the former section it will appear
that the problem of the arrangement of the electrons in the atoms
is intimately connected with the question of the confluence of two
rings of electrons rotating round a nucleus outside each other,
and satisfying the condition of the universal constancy of the
angular momentum. Apart from the necessary conditions of stability
for displacements of the electrons perpendicular to the plane of
the orbits, the present theory gives very little information on
this problem. It seems, however, possible by the help of simple
considerations to throw some light on the question.</p>

<p>Let us consider two rings rotating round a nucleus in a single plane,
the one outside the other. Let us assume that the electrons in the one
ring act upon the electrons in the other as if the electric charge
were uniformly distributed along the circumference of the ring, and
that the rings with this approximation satisfy the condition of the
angular momentum of the electrons and of stability for displacements
perpendicular to their plane.</p>

<p>Now suppose that, by help of suitable imaginary extraneous forces
acting parallel to the axis of the rings, we pull the inner ring slowly
to one side. During this process, on account of the repulsion from the
inner ring, the outer will move to the opposite side of the original
plane of the rings. During the displacements of the rings the angular
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>
momentum of the electrons round the axis of the system will remain
constant, and the diameter of the inner ring will increase while that
of the outer will diminish. At the beginning of the displacement the
magnitude of the extraneous forces to be applied to the original inner
ring will increase but thereafter decrease, and at a certain distance
between the plane of the rings the system will be in a configuration of
equilibrium. This equilibrium, however, will not be stable. If we let
the rings slowly return they will either reach their original position,
or they will arrive at a position in which the ring, which originally
was the outer, is now the inner, and <i>vice versa</i>.</p>

<p>If the charge of the electrons were uniformly distributed along the
circumference of the rings, we could by the process considered at most
obtain an interchange of the rings, but obviously not a junction of
them. Taking, however, the discrete distribution of the electrons into
account, it can be shown that, in the special case when the number
of electrons on the two rings are equal, and when the rings rotate
in the same direction, the rings will unite by the process, provided
that the final configuration is stable. In this case the radii and the
frequencies of the rings will be equal in the unstable configuration
of equilibrium mentioned above. In reaching this configuration the
electrons in the one ring will further be situated just opposite the
intervals between the electrons in the other, since such an arrangement
will correspond to the smallest total energy. If now we let the rings
return to their original plane, the electrons in the one ring will
pass into the intervals between the electrons in the other, and form
a single ring. Obviously the ring thus formed will satisfy the same
condition of the angular momentum of the electrons as the original
rings.</p>

<p>If the two rings contain unequal numbers of electrons the system will
during a process such as that considered behave very differently, and,
contrary to the former case, we cannot expect that the rings will
flow together, if by help of extraneous forces acting parallel to
the axis of the system they are displaced slowly from their original
plane. It may in this connexion be noticed that the characteristic for
the displacements considered is not the special assumption about the
extraneous forces, but only the invariance of the angular momentum
of the electrons round the centre of the rings; displacements of
this kind take in the present theory a similar position to arbitrary
displacements in the ordinary mechanics.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span></p>

<p>The above considerations may be taken as an indication that there is
a greater tendency for the confluence of two rings when each contains
the same number of electrons. Considering the successive binding of
electrons by a positive nucleus, we conclude from this that, unless
the charge on the nucleus is very great, rings of electrons will only
join together if they contain equal numbers of electrons; and that
accordingly the numbers of electrons on inner rings will only be <span class="nowrap"><img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 1.131ex; height: 1.507ex;" src="images/136.svg" alt=" " data-tex="2">,</span>
<span class="nowrap"><img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 1.131ex; height: 1.532ex;" src="images/279.svg" alt=" " data-tex="4">,</span> <span class="nowrap"><img style="vertical-align: -0.05ex; width: 1.131ex; height: 1.557ex;" src="images/280.svg" alt=" " data-tex="8">,</span>.... If the charge of the nucleus is very great the rings of
electrons first bound, if few in number, will be very close together,
and we must expect that the configuration will be very unstable, and
that a gradual interchange of electrons between the rings will be
greatly facilitated.</p>

<p>This assumption in regard to the number of electrons in the rings is
strongly supported by the fact that the chemical properties of the
elements of low atomic weight vary with a period of <span class="nowrap"><img style="vertical-align: -0.05ex; width: 1.131ex; height: 1.557ex;" src="images/280.svg" alt=" " data-tex="8">.</span> Further, it
follows that the number of electrons on the outermost ring will always
be odd or even, according as the total number of electrons in the
atom is odd or even. This has a suggestive relation to the fact that
the valency of an element of low atomic weight always is odd or even
according as the number of the element in the periodic series is odd or
even.</p>

<p>For the atoms of the elements considered in the former section we have
assumed that the two electrons first bound are arranged in a single
ring, and, further, that the two next electrons are arranged in another
ring. If <img style="vertical-align: -0.396ex; width: 6.157ex; height: 2.1ex;" src="images/281.svg" alt=" " data-tex="N \geqq 4"> the configuration <img style="vertical-align: -0.8ex; width: 4.049ex; height: 2.345ex;" src="images/282.svg" alt=" " data-tex="N_{(4)}"> will correspond
to a smaller value for the total energy than the configuration
<span class="nowrap"><img style="vertical-align: -0.8ex; width: 5.294ex; height: 2.345ex;" src="images/283.svg" alt=" " data-tex="N_{(2,2)}">.</span> The greater the value of <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 2.009ex; height: 1.545ex;" src="images/151.svg" alt=" " data-tex="N"> the closer will the ratio

approach unity, and the greater will be the energy emitted by an
eventual confluence of the rings. The particular member of the series
of the elements for which the four innermost electrons will be arranged

electropositive elements respectively the number of hydrogen atoms and
twice the number of oxygen atoms with which one atom of the element
combines.</p>

<p>Such an arrangement of the outer electrons is suggested by
considerations of atomic volumes. As is well known, the atomic
volume of the elements is a periodic function of the atomic weights.
If arranged in the usual way according to the periodic system, the
elements inside the same column have approximately the same atomic
volume, while this volume changes considerably from one column to
another, being greatest for columns corresponding to the smallest
valency <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 1.131ex; height: 1.507ex;" src="images/112.svg" alt=" " data-tex="1"> and smallest for the greatest valency <span class="nowrap"><img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 1.131ex; height: 1.532ex;" src="images/279.svg" alt=" " data-tex="4">.</span> An

Accordingly the arrangement chosen for the electrons will involve a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>
variation in the dimensions of the outer ring similar to the variation
in the atomic volumes of the corresponding elements. It must, however,
be borne in mind that the experimental determinations of atomic volumes
in most cases are deduced from consideration of molecules rather than
atoms.</p>

<p>From the above we are led to the following possible scheme for the
arrangement of the electrons in light atoms:—</p>

<p>Without any fuller discussion it seems not unlikely that this
constitution of the atoms will correspond to properties of the elements
similar with those observed.</p>

<p>In the first place there will be a marked periodicity with a period of
<span class="nowrap"><img style="vertical-align: -0.05ex; width: 1.131ex; height: 1.557ex;" src="images/280.svg" alt=" " data-tex="8">.</span> Further, the binding of the outer electrons in every horizontal
series of the above scheme will become weaker with increasing number
of electrons per atom, corresponding to the observed increase of the
electropositive character for an increase of atomic weight of the
elements in every single group of the periodic system. A corresponding
agreement holds for the variation of the atomic volumes.</p>

<p>In the case of atoms of higher atomic weight the simple assumptions
used do not apply. A few indications, however, are suggested from
consideration of the variations in the chemical properties of the
elements. At the end of the 3rd period of <img style="vertical-align: -0.05ex; width: 1.131ex; height: 1.557ex;" src="images/280.svg" alt=" " data-tex="8"> elements we meet with
the iron-group. This group takes a particular position in the system of
the elements, since it is the first time that elements of neighbouring
atomic weights show similar chemical properties. This circumstance
indicates that the configurations of the electrons in the elements
of this group differ only in the arrangement of the inner electrons.
The fact that the period in the chemical properties of the elements
after the iron-group is no longer <span class="nowrap"><img style="vertical-align: -0.05ex; width: 1.131ex; height: 1.557ex;" src="images/280.svg" alt=" " data-tex="8">,</span> but <span class="nowrap"><img style="vertical-align: -0.05ex; width: 2.262ex; height: 1.557ex;" src="images/322.svg" alt=" " data-tex="18">,</span> suggests that

two parallel rings (see <a href="#Page_36">p. 36</a>). Such a configuration of the inner

as a nucleus of charge <span class="nowrap"><img style="vertical-align: -0.566ex; width: 9.348ex; height: 2.262ex;" src="images/323.svg" alt=" " data-tex="(N — 18)e">.</span> It might therefore be possible
that with increase of <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 2.009ex; height: 1.545ex;" src="images/151.svg" alt=" " data-tex="N"> another configuration of the same type will

second period of <img style="vertical-align: -0.05ex; width: 2.262ex; height: 1.557ex;" src="images/322.svg" alt=" " data-tex="18"> elements.</p>

<p>On the same lines, the presence of the group of the rare earths
indicates that for still greater values of <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 2.009ex; height: 1.545ex;" src="images/151.svg" alt=" " data-tex="N"> another gradual
alteration of the innermost rings will take place. Since, however, for
elements of higher atomic weight than those of this group, the laws
connecting the variation of the chemical properties with the atomic
weight are similar to those between the elements of low atomic weight,
we may conclude that the configuration of the innermost electrons will
be again repeated. The theory, however, is not sufficiently complete to
give a definite answer to such problems.</p>

<a id="5_1">§5. <i>Characteristic Röntgen Radiation.</i></a></p>


<p>According to the theory of emission of radiation given in <a href="#PART_I">Part I.</a>, the
ordinary line-spectrum of an element is emitted during the reformation
of an atom when one or more of the electrons in the outer rings
are removed. In analogy it may be supposed that the characteristic
Röntgen radiation is sent out during the settling down of the system
if electrons in inner rings are removed by some agency, <i>e.
g</i>. by impact of cathode particles. This view of the origin of
the characteristic Röntgen radiation has been proposed by Sir J. J.
Thomson<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a>.</p>

<p>Without any special assumption in regard to the constitution of the
radiation, we can from this view determine the minimum velocity of the
cathode rays necessary to produce the characteristic Röntgen radiation
of a special type by calculating the energy necessary to remove one of
the electrons from the different rings. Even if we knew the numbers of
electrons in the rings, a rigorous calculation of this minimum energy
might still be complicated, and the result largely dependent on the
assumptions used; for, as mentioned in Part I., <a href="#Page_19">p. 19</a>, the calculation
cannot be performed entirely on the basis of the ordinary mechanics.
We can, however, obtain very simply an approximate comparison
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>
with experiments if we consider the innermost ring and as a first
approximation neglect the repulsion from the electrons in comparison
with the attraction of the nucleus. Let us consider a simple system
consisting of a bound electron rotating in a circular orbit round a
positive nucleus of charge From the expressions (1) on <a href="#Page_28">p. 28</a> we get
for the velocity of the electron, putting <span class="nowrap"><img style="vertical-align: -0.186ex; width: 6.721ex; height: 1.731ex;" src="images/324.svg" alt=" " data-tex="F = N">,</span>
<span class="align-center"><img style="vertical-align: -1.577ex; width: 25.013ex; height: 4.993ex;" src="images/73.svg" alt=" " data-tex="
v = \frac{2 \pi e^{2}}{h}N = 2.1 \cdot 10^{8}N.
"></span></p>

<p>The total energy to be transferred to the system in order to remove
the electron to an infinite distance from the nucleus is equal to the
kinetic energy of the bound electron. If, therefore, the electron is
removed to a great distance from the nucleus by impact of another
rapidly moving electron, the smallest kinetic energy possessed by the
latter when at a great distance from the nucleus must necessarily be
equal to the kinetic energy of the bound electron before the collision.
The velocity of the free electron therefore must be at least equal to
<span class="nowrap"><img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.097ex; height: 1.027ex;" src="images/180.svg" alt=" " data-tex="v">.</span></p>

<p>According to Whiddington’s experiments<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> the velocity of cathode
rays just able to produce the characteristic Röntgen radiation of the
so-called <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 2.011ex; height: 1.545ex;" src="images/144.svg" alt=" " data-tex="K">-type—the hardest type of radiation observed—from an
element of atomic weight <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 1.697ex; height: 1.62ex;" src="images/325.svg" alt=" " data-tex="A"> is for elements from Al to Se
approximately equal to <span class="nowrap"><img style="vertical-align: -0.566ex; width: 15.326ex; height: 2.52ex;" src="images/326.svg" alt=" " data-tex="A \cdot 10^{8}~ \text{cm./sec.}">.</span> As seen
this is equal to the above calculated value for <span class="nowrap"><img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.097ex; height: 1.027ex;" src="images/180.svg" alt=" " data-tex="v">,</span> if we put

<p>Since we have obtained approximate agreement with experiment by
ascribing the characteristic Röntgen radiation of the <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 2.011ex; height: 1.545ex;" src="images/144.svg" alt=" " data-tex="K">-type
to the innermost ring, it is to be expected that no harder type of
characteristic radiation will exist. This is strongly indicated by
observations of the penetrating-power of <img style="vertical-align: -0.489ex; width: 1.229ex; height: 1.486ex;" src="images/328.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\gamma"> rays<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a>.</p>

<p>It is worthy of remark that the theory gives not only nearly the right
value for the energy required to remove an electron from the outer
ring, but also the energy required to remove an electron from the
innermost ring. The approximate agreement between the calculated and
experimental values is all the more striking when it is recalled that

<p>In connexion with this it should be emphasized that the remarkable

homogeneity of the characteristic Röntgen radiation—indicated by
experiments on absorption of the rays, as well as by the interference
observed in recent experiments on diffraction of Röntgen rays in
crystals—is in agreement with the main assumption used in Part I.
(see <a href="#Page_7">p. 7</a>) in considering the emission of line-spectra, viz. that the
radiation emitted during the passing of the systems between different
stationary states is homogeneous.</p>

§6. <i>Radioactive Phenomena.</i></p>


<p>According to the present theory the cluster of electrons surrounding
the nucleus is formed with emission of energy, and the configuration
is determined by the condition that the energy emitted is a maximum.
The stability involved by these assumptions seems to be in agreement
with the general properties of matter. It is, however, in striking
opposition to the phenomena of radioactivity, and according to the
theory the origin of the latter phenomena may therefore be sought
elsewhere than in the electronic distribution round the nucleus.</p>

<p>A necessary consequence of Rutherford’s theory of the structure of
atoms is that the <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.448ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/99.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\alpha">-particles have their origin in the
nucleus. On the present theory it seems also necessary that the nucleus
is the seat of the expulsion of the high-speed <img style="vertical-align: -0.439ex; width: 1.281ex; height: 2.034ex;" src="images/171.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\beta">-particles. In
the first place, the spontaneous expulsion of a <img style="vertical-align: -0.439ex; width: 1.281ex; height: 2.034ex;" src="images/171.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\beta">-particle from
the cluster of electrons surrounding the nucleus would be something
quite foreign to the assumed properties of the system. Further, the
expulsion of an <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.448ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/99.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\alpha">-particle can hardly be expected to produce
a lasting effect on the stability of the cluster of electrons. The
effect of the expulsion will be of two different kinds. Partly the
particle may collide with the bound electrons during its passing
through the atom. This effect will be analogous to that produced by
bombardment of atoms of other substances by <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.448ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/99.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\alpha">-rays and cannot
be expected to give rise to a subsequent expulsion of <img style="vertical-align: -0.439ex; width: 1.281ex; height: 2.034ex;" src="images/171.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\beta">-rays.
Partly the expulsion of the particle will involve an alteration in the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span>
configuration of the bound electrons, since the charge remaining on
the nucleus is different from the original. In order to consider the
latter effect let us regard a single ring of electrons rotating round a
nucleus of charge <span class="nowrap"><img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 3.063ex; height: 1.57ex;" src="images/183.svg" alt=" " data-tex="Ne">,</span> and let us assume that an <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.448ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/99.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\alpha">-particle
is expelled from the nucleus in a direction perpendicular to the plane
of the ring. The expulsion of the particle will obviously not produce
any alteration in the angular momentum of the electrons; and if the
velocity of the <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.448ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/99.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\alpha">-particle is small compared with the velocity
of the electrons—as it will be if we consider inner rings of an atom
of high atomic weight—the ring during the expulsion will expand
continuously, and after the expulsion will take the position claimed by
the theory for a stable ring rotating round a nucleus of charge <span class="nowrap"><img style="vertical-align: -0.566ex; width: 8.72ex; height: 2.262ex;" src="images/335.svg" alt=" " data-tex="(N - 2)e">.</span>
The consideration of this simple case strongly indicates that
the expulsion of an <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.448ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/99.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\alpha">-particle will not have a lasting effect
on the stability of the internal rings of electrons in the residual
atom.</p>

<p>The question of the origin of <img style="vertical-align: -0.439ex; width: 1.281ex; height: 2.034ex;" src="images/171.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\beta">-particles may also be
considered from another point of view, based on a consideration of the
chemical and physical properties of the radioactive substances. As is
well known, several of these substances have very similar chemical
properties and have hitherto resisted every attempt to separate them
by chemical means. There is also some evidence that the substances in
question show the same line-spectrum<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a>. It has been suggested by
several writers that the substances are different only in radioactive
properties and atomic weight but identical in all other physical and
chemical respects. According to the theory, this would mean that the
charge on the nucleus, as well as the configuration of the surrounding
electrons, was identical in some of the elements, the only difference
being the mass and the internal constitution of the nucleus. From the
considerations of <a href="#4_1">§4</a> this assumption is already strongly suggested by
the fact that the number of radioactive substances is greater than the
number of places at our disposal in the periodic system. If, however,
the assumption is right, the fact that two apparently identical
elements emit <img style="vertical-align: -0.439ex; width: 1.281ex; height: 2.034ex;" src="images/171.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\beta">-particles of different velocities, shows that
the <img style="vertical-align: -0.439ex; width: 1.281ex; height: 2.034ex;" src="images/171.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\beta">-rays as well as the <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.448ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/99.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\alpha">-rays have their origin in
the nucleus.</p>

<p>This view of the origin of <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.448ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/99.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\alpha">- and <img style="vertical-align: -0.439ex; width: 1.281ex; height: 2.034ex;" src="images/171.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\beta">-particles explains
very simply the way in which the change in the chemical properties
of the radioactive substances is connected with the nature of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>
particles emitted. The results of experiments are expressed in the two
rules<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a>:—</p>

<p>1. Whenever an <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.448ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/99.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\alpha">-particle is expelled the group in the
periodic system to which the resultant product belongs is two units
less than that to which the parent body belongs.</p>

<p>2. Whenever a <img style="vertical-align: -0.439ex; width: 1.281ex; height: 2.034ex;" src="images/171.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\beta">-particle is expelled, the group of the
resultant body is <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 1.131ex; height: 1.507ex;" src="images/112.svg" alt=" " data-tex="1"> unit greater than that of the parent.</p>

<p>As will be seen this is exactly what is to be expected according to the
considerations of <a href="#4_1">§4</a>.</p>

<p>In escaping from the nucleus, the <img style="vertical-align: -0.439ex; width: 1.281ex; height: 2.034ex;" src="images/171.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\beta">-rays may be expected to
collide with the bound electrons in the inner rings. This will give
rise to an emission of a characteristic radiation of the same type as
the characteristic Röntgen radiation emitted from elements of lower
atomic weight by impact of cathode-rays. The assumption that the
emission of <img style="vertical-align: -0.489ex; width: 1.229ex; height: 1.486ex;" src="images/328.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\gamma">-rays is due to collisions of <img style="vertical-align: -0.439ex; width: 1.281ex; height: 2.034ex;" src="images/171.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\beta">-rays with
bound electrons is proposed by Rutherford<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> in order to account for
the numerous groups of homogeneous <img style="vertical-align: -0.439ex; width: 1.281ex; height: 2.034ex;" src="images/171.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\beta">-rays expelled from certain
radioactive substances.</p>

<p class="space-above2">
In the present paper it has been attempted to show that the application
of Planck’s theory of radiation to Rutherford’s atom-model through
the introduction of the hypothesis of the universal constancy of the
angular momentum of the bound electrons, leads to results which seem to
be in agreement with experiments.</p>

<p>In a later paper the theory will be applied to systems containing more
than one nucleus.</p>

<p class="nind">
ACCORDING to Rutherford's theory of the structure of atoms, the
difference between an atom of an element and a molecule of a chemical
combination is that the first consists of a cluster of electrons
surrounding a single positive nucleus of exceedingly small dimensions
and of a mass great in comparison with that of the electrons, while
the latter contains at least two nuclei at distances from each other
comparable with the distances apart of the electrons in the surrounding
cluster.</p>

<p>The leading idea used in the former papers was that the atoms were
formed through the successive binding by the nucleus of a number of
electrons initially nearly at rest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span></p>

<p>Such a conception, however, cannot be utilized in considering the
formation of a system containing more than a single nucleus; for in the
latter case there will be nothing to keep the nuclei together during
the binding of the electrons. In this connexion it may be noticed that
while a single nucleus carrying a large positive charge is able to bind
a small number of electrons, on the contrary, two nuclei highly charged
obviously cannot be kept together by the help of a few electrons. We
must therefore assume that configurations containing several nuclei
are formed by the interaction of systems—each containing a single
nucleus—which already have bound a number of electrons.</p>

<p><a href="#2_2">§2</a> deals with the configuration and stability of a system already
formed. We shall consider only the simple case of a system consisting
of two nuclei and of a ring of electrons rotating round the line
connecting them; the result of the calculation, however, gives
indication of what configurations are to be expected in more
complicated cases. As in the former papers, we shall assume that the
conditions of equilibrium can be deduced by help of the ordinary
mechanics. In determining the absolute dimensions and the stability
of the systems, however, we shall use the main hypothesis of <a href="#PART_I">Part I.</a>
According to this, the angular momentum of every electron round the
centre of its orbit is equal to a universal value <img style="vertical-align: -1.577ex; width: 3.416ex; height: 4.676ex;" src="images/172.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\dfrac{h}{2 \pi}">
where <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.303ex; height: 1.595ex;" src="images/110.svg" alt=" " data-tex="h"> is Planck’s constant; further, the stability is determined
by the condition that the total energy of the system is less than in
any neighbouring configuration satisfying the same condition of the
angular momentum of the electrons.</p>

<p>In <a href="#3_2">§3</a> the configuration to be expected for a hydrogen molecule is
discussed in some detail.</p>

<p><a href="#4_2">§4</a> deals with the mode of formation of the systems. A simple method
of procedure is indicated, by which it is possible to follow, step
by step, the combination of two atoms to form a molecule. The
configuration obtained will be shown to satisfy the conditions used in
<a href="#2_2">§2</a>. The part played in the considerations by the angular momentum of
the electrons strongly supports the validity of the main hypothesis.</p>

<p><a href="#5_2">§5</a> contains a few indications of the configurations to be expected for
systems containing a greater number of electrons.</p>

<p>To test the stability of the system we have to consider displacements

displacements of the latter relative to each other.</p>

<p>A calculation based on the ordinary mechanics gives that the systems
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>
are unstable for displacements of the electrons in the plane of the
ring. As for the systems considered in <a href="#PART_II">Part II.</a>, we shall, however,
assume that the ordinary principles of mechanics cannot be used in
discussing the problem in question, and that the stability of the
systems for the displacements considered is secured through the
introduction of the hypothesis of the universal constancy of the
angular momentum of the electrons. This assumption is included in the
condition of stability stated in <a href="#1_2">§1</a>. It should be noticed that in

By help of this expression and using the table for <img style="vertical-align: -0.65ex; width: 10.431ex; height: 1.969ex;" src="images/204.svg" alt=" " data-tex="p_{n,0} - p_{n,m}">
given on <a href="#Page_32">p. 32</a> in Part II., it can be simply shown that the
system in question will not be stable unless <img style="vertical-align: -0.186ex; width: 6.157ex; height: 1.731ex;" src="images/346.svg" alt=" " data-tex="N = 1"> and <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.357ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/155.svg" alt=" " data-tex="n"> equal

<p>In considering the stability of the systems for a displacement of the
nuclei relative to each other, we shall assume that the motions of the
nuclei are so slow that the state of motion of the electrons at any
moment will not differ sensibly from that calculated on the assumption
that the nuclei are at rest. This assumption is permissible on account
of the great mass of the nuclei compared with that of the electrons,
which involves that the vibrations resulting from a displacement of
the nuclei are very slow compared with those due to a displacement of
the electrons. For a system consisting of a ring of electrons and two
nuclei of equal charge, we shall thus assume that the electrons at any
moment daring the displacement of the nuclei move in circular orbits in
the plane of symmetry of the latter.</p>

<p>Let us now imagine that, by help of extraneous forces acting on
the nuclei, we slowly vary the distance between them. During the
displacement the radius of the ring of electrons will vary in
consequence of the alteration of the radial force due to the attraction
of the nuclei. During this variation the angular momentum of each
of the electrons round the line connecting the nuclei will remain
constant. If the distance apart of the nuclei increases, the radius
of the ring will obviously also increase; the radius, however, will
increase at a slower rate than the distance between the nuclei.
For example, imagine a displacement in which the distance as well
as the radius are both increased to a times their original value.
In the new configuration the radial force acting on an electron
from the nuclei and the other electrons is <img style="vertical-align: -1.654ex; width: 3.431ex; height: 4.69ex;" src="images/348.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\dfrac{1}{\alpha ^{2}}">
times that in the original configuration. From the constancy of
the angular momentum of the electrons during the displacement,
it further follows that the velocity of the electrons in the new
configuration is <img style="vertical-align: -1.577ex; width: 2.443ex; height: 4.613ex;" src="images/349.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\dfrac{1}{\alpha}"> times, and the centrifugal force
<img style="vertical-align: -1.652ex; width: 3.431ex; height: 4.688ex;" src="images/350.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\dfrac{1}{\alpha ^{3}}"> times that in the original. Consequently, the
radial force is greater than the centrifugal force.</p>

<p>On account of the distance between the nuclei increasing faster than
the radius of the ring, the attraction on one of the nuclei due to the
ring will be greater than the repulsion from the other nucleus. The
work done during the displacement by the extraneous forces acting on
the nuclei will therefore be positive, and the system will be stable
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span>
for the displacement. Obviously the same result will hold in the case
of the distance between the nuclei diminishing. It may be noticed that
in the above considerations we have not made use of any new assumption
on the dynamics of the electrons, but have only used the principle of
the invariance of the angular momentum, which is common both for the
ordinary mechanics and for the main hypothesis of <a href="#1_2">§1</a>.</p>

<p>For a system consisting of a ring of electrons and two nuclei of
unequal charge, the investigation of the stability is more complicated.
As before, we find that the systems are always stable for displacements
of the electrons in the plane of the ring; also an expression
corresponding to (4) will hold for the condition of stability for
displacements perpendicular to the plane of the ring. This condition,
however, will not be sufficient to secure the stability of the system.
For a displacement of the electrons perpendicular to the plane of the
ring, the variation of the radial force due to the nuclei will be of
the same order of magnitude as the displacement; therefore, in the new
configuration the radial force will not be in equilibrium with the
centrifugal force, and, if the radius of the orbits is varied until the
radial equilibrium is restored, the energy of the system will decrease.
This circumstance must be taken into account in applying the condition
of stability of <a href="#1_2">§1</a>. Similar complications arise in the calculation
of stability for displacements of the nuclei. For a variation of the
distance apart of the nuclei not only will the radius of the ring vary
but also the ratio in which the plane of the ring divides the line
connecting the nuclei. As a consequence, the full discussion of the
general case is rather lengthy; an approximate numerical calculation,
however, shows that the systems, as in the former case, will be
unstable unless the charges on the nuclei are small and the ring
contains very few electrons.</p>

<p>The above considerations suggest configurations of systems, consisting
of two positive nuclei and a number of electrons, which are consistent
with the arrangement of the electrons to be expected in molecules
of chemical combinations. If we thus consider a neutral system
containing two nuclei with great charges, it follows that in a stable
configuration the greater part of the electrons must be arranged around
each nucleus approximately as if the other nucleus were absent; and
that only a few of the outer electrons will be arranged differently
rotating in a ring round the line connecting the nuclei, The latter
ring, which keeps the system together, represents the chemical “bond.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span></p>

<p>A first rough approximation of the possible configuration of such a
ring can be obtained by considering simple systems consisting of a
single ring rotating round the line connecting two nuclei of minute
dimensions. A detailed discussion, however, of the configuration of
systems containing a greater number of electrons, taking the effect of
inner rings into account, involves elaborate numerical calculations.
Apart from a few indications given in <a href="#5_2">§5</a>, we shall in this paper
confine ourselves to systems containing very few electrons.</p>

experiments based on Drude’s theory gives a value near two for the
number of electrons in a hydrogen molecule. The latter result might
have connexion with the fact that the frequencies calculated above
for the radiation absorbed corresponding to vibrations parallel and
perpendicular to the plane of the ring are nearly equal. As mentioned
in <a href="#PART_II">Part II.</a>, the number of electrons in a helium atom calculated from
experiments on dispersion is only about ⅔ of the number of electrons
to be expected in the atom, viz. two. For a helium atom, as for a
hydrogen molecule, the frequency determined by the relation <img style="vertical-align: -0.186ex; width: 8.882ex; height: 1.756ex;" src="images/363.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\nu \cdot h = E">
agrees closely with the frequency observed from dispersion; in
the helium system, however, the frequency corresponding to vibrations
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span>
perpendicular to the plane of the ring is more than three times as
great as the frequency in question, and consequently of negligible
influence on the dispersion.</p>

<p>In order to determine the frequency of vibration of the system
corresponding to displacement of the nuclei relative to each other,
let us consider a configuration in which the radius of the ring is
equal to <span class="nowrap"><img style="vertical-align: -0.464ex; width: 1.109ex; height: 1.464ex;" src="images/364.svg" alt=" " data-tex="y">,</span> and the distance apart of the nuclei <span class="nowrap"><img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 2.425ex; height: 1.532ex;" src="images/365.svg" alt=" " data-tex="2x">.</span> The

Let us now consider a slow displacement of the system during which the
radial force balances the centrifugal force due to the rotation of the
electrons, and the angular momentum of the latter remains constant.

Einstein’s theory from the variation of the specific heat of hydrogen
gas with temperature<a id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a>. On the other hand, no absorption of radiation
in hydrogen gas corresponding to this frequency is observed. This is,
however, just what we should expect on account of the symmetrical
structure of the system and the great ratio between the frequencies
corresponding to displacements of the electrons and of the nuclei.
The complete absence of infra-red absorption in hydrogen gas might
be considered as a strong argument in support of a constitution of a
hydrogen molecule like that adopted here, compared with model-molecules
in which the chemical bond is assumed to have its origin in an opposite
charge of the entering atoms.</p>

a system has been obtained by Sir J. J. Thomson in his experiments on
positive rays<a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a>.</p>

explanation of the appearance of positively charged hydrogen molecules
in experiments on positive rays may therefore at first sight be
considered as a serious difficulty for the present theory. A possible
explanation, however, might be sought in the special conditions under
which the systems are observed. We are probably dealing in such a case
not with the formation of a stationary system by a regular interaction
of systems containing single nuclei (see the next section), but rather
with a delay in the breaking up of a configuration brought about by the
sudden removal of one of the electrons by impact of a single particle.</p>

electrons will approach the nucleus of charge <span class="nowrap"><img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 2.186ex; height: 1.532ex;" src="images/134.svg" alt=" " data-tex="2e">.</span> Consequently,
the vibration must be expected to be connected with an absorption of
radiation.</p>


<p class="nindc space-above2 space-below2">
<a id="4_2">§4. <i>Formation of the Systems.</i></a></p>


<p>As mentioned in <a href="#1_2">§1</a>, we cannot assume that systems containing more than
one nucleus are formed by successive binding of electrons, such as we
have assumed for the systems considered in <a href="#PART_II">Part II</a>. We must assume
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span>
that the systems are formed by the interaction of others, containing
single nuclei, which already have bound electrons. We shall now
consider this problem more closely, starting with the simplest possible
case, viz., the combination of two hydrogen atoms to form a molecule.</p>

<p>Consider two hydrogen atoms at a distance apart great in comparison
with the linear dimensions of the orbits of the electrons, and imagine
that by help of extraneous forces acting on the nuclei, we make these
approach each other; the displacements, however, being so slow that the
dynamical equilibrium of the electrons for every position of the nuclei
is the same as if the latter were at rest.</p>

<p>Suppose that the electrons originally rotate in parallel planes
perpendicular to the straight line connecting the nuclei, and that the
direction of rotation is the same and the difference in phase equal to
half a revolution. During the approach of the nuclei, the direction
of the planes of the orbits of the electrons and the difference in
phase will be unaltered. The planes of the orbits, however, will at
the beginning of the process approach each other at a higher rate than
do the nuclei. By the continued displacement of the latter the planes
of the orbits of the electrons will approach each other more and more,
until finally for a certain distance apart of the nuclei the planes
will coincide, the electrons being arranged in a single ring rotating
in the plane of symmetry of the nuclei. During the further approach of
the nuclei the ratio between the diameter of the ring of electrons and
the distance apart of the nuclei will increase, and the system will
pass through a configuration in which it will be in equilibrium without
the application of extraneous forces on the nuclei.</p>

<p>By help of a calculation similar to that indicated in <a href="#2_2">§2</a>, it can be
simply shown that at any moment during this process the configuration
of the electrons is stable for a displacement perpendicular to the
plane of the orbits. In addition, during the whole operation the
angular momentum of each of the electrons round the line connecting
the nuclei will remain constant, and the configuration of equilibrium
obtained will therefore be identical with the one adopted in <a href="#3_2">§3</a> for a
hydrogen molecule. As there shown, the configuration will correspond to
a smaller value for the total energy than the one corresponding to two
isolated atoms. During the process, the forces between the particles of
the system will therefore have done work against the extraneous forces
acting on the nuclei; this fact may be expressed by saying that the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span>
atoms have “attracted” each other during the combination. A closer
calculation shows that for any distance apart of the nuclei greater
than that corresponding to the configuration of equilibrium, the forces
acting on the nuclei, due to the particles of the system, will be in
such a direction as to diminish the distance between the nuclei; while
for any smaller distance the forces will have the opposite direction.</p>

<p>By means of these considerations, a possible process is indicated
for the combination of two hydrogen atoms to form a molecule. This
operation can be followed step by step without introducing any new
assumption on the dynamics of the electrons, and leads to the same
configuration adopted in <a href="#3_2">§3</a> for a hydrogen molecule. It may be recalled
that the latter configuration was deduced directly by help of the
principal hypothesis of the universal constancy of the angular momentum
of the electrons. These considerations also offer an explanation of
the “affinity” of two atoms. It may be remarked that the assumption in
regard to the slowness of the motion of the nuclei relative to those
of the electrons is satisfied to a high degree of approximation in
a collision between two atoms of a gas at ordinary temperatures. In
assuming a special arrangement of the electrons at the beginning of the
process, very little information, however, is obtained by this method
on the chance of combination due to an arbitrary collision between two
atoms.</p>

<p>Another way in which a neutral hydrogen molecule may be formed is
by the combination of a positively and a negatively charged atom.
According to the theory a positively charged hydrogen atom is simply a
nucleus of vanishing dimensions and of charge <span class="nowrap"><img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.054ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/115.svg" alt=" " data-tex="e">,</span> while a negatively
charged atom is a system consisting of a nucleus surrounded by a ring
of two electrons. As shown in <a href="#PART_II">Part II.</a>, the latter system may be
considered as possible, since the energy emitted by the formation of
it is greater than the corresponding energy for a neutral hydrogen
atom. Let us now imagine that, by a slow displacement of the nuclei,
as before, a negatively and a positively charged atom combine. We must
assume that, when the nuclei have approached a distance equal to that
in the configuration adopted for a hydrogen molecule, the electrons
will be arranged in the same way, since this is the only stable
configuration for this distance in which the angular momentum of the
electrons has the value prescribed by the theory. The state of motion
of the electrons will, however, not vary in a continuous way with the
displacement of the nuclei as in the combination of two neutral atoms.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span>
For a certain distance apart of the nuclei the configuration of the
electrons will be unstable and suddenly change by a finite amount; this
is immediately deduced from the fact that the motion of the electrons
by the combination of two neutral hydrogen atoms considered above,
passes through an uninterrupted series of stable configurations. The
work done by the system against the extraneous forces acting on the
nuclei will therefore, in the case of the combination of a negatively
and a positively charged atom, not be equal to the difference in energy
between the original and the final configuration; but in passing
through the unstable configurations a radiation of energy must be
emitted, corresponding to that emitted during the binding of electrons
by a single nucleus and considered in Parts <a href="#PART_I">I.</a> and <a href="#PART_II">II.</a></p>

<p>On the above view, it follows that in the breaking up of a hydrogen
molecule by slowly increasing the distance apart of the nuclei, we
obtain two <i>neutral</i> hydrogen atoms and not a positively and a
negatively charged one. This is in agreement with deductions drawn from
experiments on positive rays<a id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a>.</p>

<p>Next imagine that instead of two hydrogen atoms we consider two helium
atoms, <i>i. e</i>. systems consisting of a nucleus of charge <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 2.186ex; height: 1.532ex;" src="images/134.svg" alt=" " data-tex="2e">
surrounded by a ring of two electrons, and go through a similar process
to that considered on <a href="#Page_64">p. 64</a>. Assume that the helium atoms at the
beginning of the operation are orientated relatively to each other
like the hydrogen atoms, but with the exception that the phases of the
electrons in the helium atoms differ by one quarter of a revolution
instead of one half revolution as in the case of hydrogen. By the
displacement of the nuclei, the planes of the rings of electrons will,
as in the former case, approach each other at a higher rate than the
nuclei, and for a certain position of the latter the planes will
coincide. During the further approach of the nuclei, the electrons
will be arranged at equal angular intervals in a single ring. As
in the former case, it can be shown that at any moment during this
operation the system will be stable for a displacement of the electrons
perpendicular to the plane of the rings. Contrary, however, to what
took place in the case of hydrogen, the extraneous forces to be applied
to the nuclei in order to keep the system in equilibrium will always
be in a direction to diminish the distance apart of the nuclei, and
the system will never pass through a configuration of equilibrium;
the helium atoms will, during the process, “repel” each other. The
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span>
consideration offers an explanation of the refusal of helium atoms to
combine into molecules by a close approach of the atoms.</p>

<p>Instead of two hydrogen or two helium atoms, next consider a hydrogen
and a helium atom, and let us slowly approach the nuclei to each other
in a similar way. In this case, contrary to the former cases, the
electrons will have no tendency to flow together in a single ring.
On account of the great difference in the radii of the orbits of the
electrons in hydrogen and helium, the electron of the hydrogen atom
must be expected to rotate always outside the helium ring, and if
the nuclei are brought very close together, the configuration of the
electrons will coincide with that adopted in <a href="#PART_II">Part II.</a> for a lithium
atom. Further, the extraneous forces to be applied to the nuclei during
the process will be in such a direction as to diminish the distance
apart. In this way, therefore, we cannot obtain a combination of the
atoms.</p>

<p>The stable configuration considered in <a href="#3_2">§3</a>, consisting of a ring of
three electrons and two nuclei of charge <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.054ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/115.svg" alt=" " data-tex="e"> and <span class="nowrap"><img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 2.186ex; height: 1.532ex;" src="images/134.svg" alt=" " data-tex="2e">,</span> cannot
be expected to be formed by such a process, unless the ring of
electrons were bound originally by one of the nuclei. Neither a
hydrogen nor a helium nucleus will, however, be able to bind a ring
of three electrons, since such a configuration would correspond to
a greater total energy than the one in which the nucleus has bound
two electrons (comp. Part II. p<a href="#Page_38">p. 38</a> and
<a href="#Page_40">40</a>). As mentioned in <a href="#3_2">§3</a>,
such a configuration cannot therefore be considered as representing a
possible combination of hydrogen and helium, in spite of the fact that
the value of <img style="vertical-align: -0.05ex; width: 2.371ex; height: 1.595ex;" src="images/102.svg" alt=" " data-tex="W"> is greater than the sum of the values of <img style="vertical-align: -0.05ex; width: 2.371ex; height: 1.595ex;" src="images/102.svg" alt=" " data-tex="W"> for
a hydrogen and a helium atom. As we shall see in the next section, the
configuration may, however, give indications of the possible structure
of the molecules of a certain class of chemical combinations.</p>


<p class="nindc space-above2 space-below2">
<a id="5_2">§5. <i>Systems containing a greater number of Electrons.</i></a></p>


<p>From the considerations of the former section we are led to indications
of the configuration of the electrons in systems containing a greater
number of electrons, consistent with those obtained in <a href="#2_2">§2</a>.</p>

<p>Let us imagine that, in a similar way to that considered on <a href="#Page_64">p. 64</a>
for two hydrogen atoms, we make two atoms containing a large number
of electrons approach each other. During the beginning of the process
the effect on the configuration of the inner rings will be very small
compared with the effect on the electrons in the outer rings, and
the final result will mainly depend on the number of electrons in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span>
these rings. If, for example, the outer ring in both atoms contains
only one electron, we may expect that during the approach these two
electrons will form a single ring as in the case of hydrogen. By a
further approach of the nuclei, the system will arrive at a state of
equilibrium before the distance apart of the nuclei is comparable with
the radii of the inner rings of electrons. If the distance be decreased
still further, the repulsion of the nuclei will predominate and tend to
prevent an approach of the systems.</p>

<p>In this way we are led to a possible configuration of a molecule of a
combination of two monovalent substances—such as HCl—in which the
ring of electrons representing the chemical bond is arranged in a
similar way to that assumed for a hydrogen molecule. Since, however,
as in the case of hydrogen, the energy emitted by a combination of
the atoms is only a small part of the kinetic energy of the outer
electrons, we may expect that small differences in the configuration
of the ring, due to the presence of inner rings of electrons in the
atoms, will be of great influence on the heat of combination and
consequently on the affinity of the substances. As mentioned in <a href="#2_2">§2</a>, a
detailed discussion of these questions involves elaborate numerical
calculations. We may, however, make an approximate comparison of the
theory with experiment, by considering the frequency of vibration of
the two atoms in the molecule relative to each other. In §3, <a href="#Page_62">p. 62</a>,
we have calculated this frequency for a hydrogen molecule. Since now
the binding of the atoms is assumed to be similar to that in hydrogen,
the frequency of another molecule can be simply calculated if we know
the ratio of the mass of the nuclei to be that of a hydrogen nucleus.
Denoting the frequency of a hydrogen molecule by <img style="vertical-align: -0.375ex; width: 2.105ex; height: 1.375ex;" src="images/379.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\nu_0"> and the atomic
weights of the substances entering in the combination in question by
<img style="vertical-align: -0.339ex; width: 2.685ex; height: 1.959ex;" src="images/380.svg" alt=" " data-tex="A_1"> and <img style="vertical-align: -0.339ex; width: 2.685ex; height: 1.959ex;" src="images/381.svg" alt=" " data-tex="A_2"> respectively, we get for the frequency

<p>If the two atoms are identical the molecule will be exactly
symmetrical, and we cannot expect an absorption of radiation
corresponding to the frequency in question (comp. <a href="#Page_62">p. 62</a>). For HCl gas
an infra-red absorption band corresponding to a frequency of about

<p>The molecules in question may also be formed by the combination of a
positively and a negatively charged atom. As in the case of hydrogen,
however, we shall expect to obtain two <i>neutral</i> atoms by the
breaking up of the molecule. There may be another type of molecule,
for which this does not hold, viz., molecules which are formed in a
manner analogous to the system consisting of a ring of three electrons
and two nuclei of charges <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.054ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/115.svg" alt=" " data-tex="e"> and <span class="nowrap"><img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 2.186ex; height: 1.532ex;" src="images/134.svg" alt=" " data-tex="2e">,</span> mentioned in the former
section. As we have seen, the necessary condition for the formation
of a configuration of this kind is that one of the atoms in the
molecule is able to bind three electrons in the outer ring. According
to the theory, this condition is not satisfied for a hydrogen or a
helium atom, but is for an oxygen atom. With the symbols used in <a href="#PART_II">Part II.</a>
the configuration suggested for the oxygen atom was given by
<span class="nowrap"><img style="vertical-align: -0.8ex; width: 5.853ex; height: 2.307ex;" src="images/319.svg" alt=" " data-tex="8_{(4,2,2)}">.</span> From a calculation, as that indicated in <a href="#PART_II">Part II.</a>, we get
for this configuration <span class="nowrap"><img style="vertical-align: -0.375ex; width: 15.362ex; height: 1.92ex;" src="images/386.svg" alt=" " data-tex="W = 228.07~ W_0">,</span> while for the configuration

<img style="vertical-align: -0.05ex; width: 2.371ex; height: 1.595ex;" src="images/102.svg" alt=" " data-tex="W"> is greater than the first, the configuration <img style="vertical-align: -0.8ex; width: 5.853ex; height: 2.307ex;" src="images/387.svg" alt=" " data-tex="8_{(4,2,3)}"> may be
considered as possible and as representing an oxygen atom with a single
negative charge. If now a hydrogen, nucleus approaches the system
<img style="vertical-align: -0.8ex; width: 5.853ex; height: 2.307ex;" src="images/387.svg" alt=" " data-tex="8_{(4,2,3)}"> we may expect a stable configuration to be formed in which
the outer electrons will be arranged approximately as in the system
mentioned above. In a breaking up of this configuration the ring of
three electrons will remain with the oxygen atom.</p>

<p>Such considerations suggest a possible configuration for a water
molecule, consisting of an oxygen nucleus surrounded by a small ring
of <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 1.131ex; height: 1.532ex;" src="images/279.svg" alt=" " data-tex="4"> electrons and <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 1.131ex; height: 1.507ex;" src="images/136.svg" alt=" " data-tex="2"> hydrogen nuclei situated on the axis of
the ring at equal distances apart from the first nucleus and kept in
equilibrium by help of two rings of greater radius each containing
three electrons; the latter rotate in parallel planes round the axis
of the system, and are situated relatively to each other so that
the electrons in the one ring are placed just opposite the interval
between the electrons in the other. If we imagine that such a system
is broken up by slowly removing the hydrogen nuclei we should obtain
two positively charged hydrogen atoms and an oxygen atom with a double
negative charge, in which the outermost electrons will be arranged
in two rings of three electrons each, rotating in parallel planes.
The assumption of such a configuration for a water molecule offers a
possible explanation of the great absorption of water for rays in the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span>
infra-red and for the high value of its specific inductive capacity.</p>

<p>In the preceding we have only considered systems which possess an
axis of symmetry around which the electrons are assumed to rotate in
circular orbits. In systems such as the molecule CH<sub><small>4</small></sub> we cannot,
however, assume the existence of an axis of symmetry, and consequently
we must in such cases omit the assumption of exactly circular orbits.
The configuration suggested by the theory for a molecule of CH<sub><small>4</small></sub>
is of the ordinary tetrahedron type; the carbon nucleus surrounded by
a very small ring of two electrons being situated in the centre, and a
hydrogen nucleus in every corner. The chemical bonds are represented by
<img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 1.131ex; height: 1.532ex;" src="images/279.svg" alt=" " data-tex="4"> rings of <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 1.131ex; height: 1.507ex;" src="images/136.svg" alt=" " data-tex="2"> electrons each rotating round the lines connecting
the centre and the corners. The closer discussion of such questions,
however, is far out of the range of the present theory.</p>


<p class="nindc space-above2 space-below2">
<i>Concluding remarks.</i></p>


<p>In the present paper an attempt has been made to develop a theory of
the constitution of atoms and molecules on the basis of the ideas
introduced by Planck in order to account for the radiation from a black
body, and the theory of the structure of atoms proposed by Rutherford
in order to explain the scattering of <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.448ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/99.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\alpha">-particles by matter.</p>

<p>Planck’s theory deals with the emission and absorption of radiation
from an atomic vibrator of a constant frequency, independent of the
amount of energy possessed by the system in the moment considered.
The assumption of such vibrators, however, involves the assumption of
quasi-elastic forces and is inconsistent with Rutherford’s theory,
according to which all the forces between the particles of an atomic
system vary inversely as the square of the distance apart. In order to
apply the main results obtained by Planck it is therefore necessary
to introduce new assumptions as to the emission and absorption of
radiation by an atomic system.</p>

<p>The main assumptions used in the present paper are:—</p>

<p>1. That energy radiation is not emitted (or absorbed) in the continuous
way assumed in the ordinary electrodynamics, but only during the
passing of the systems between different “stationary” states.</p>

<p>2. That the dynamical equilibrium of the systems in the stationary
stages is governed by the ordinary laws of mechanics, while these
laws do not hold for the passing of the systems between the different
stationary states.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span></p>

<p>3. That the radiation emitted during the transition of a system between
two stationary states is homogeneous, and that the relation between the
frequency <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 1.199ex; height: 1ex;" src="images/107.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\nu"> and the total amount of energy emitted <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 1.729ex; height: 1.538ex;" src="images/104.svg" alt=" " data-tex="E"> is given
by <span class="nowrap"><img style="vertical-align: -0.186ex; width: 7.248ex; height: 1.756ex;" src="images/167.svg" alt=" " data-tex="E = h \nu">,</span> where <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.303ex; height: 1.595ex;" src="images/110.svg" alt=" " data-tex="h"> is Planck’s constant.</p>

<p>4. That the different stationary states of a simple system consisting
of an electron rotating round a positive nucleus are determined by the
condition that the ratio between the total energy, emitted during the
formation of the configuration, and the frequency of revolution of the
electron is an entire multiple of <span class="nowrap"><img style="vertical-align: -1.577ex; width: 3.416ex; height: 4.676ex;" src="images/172.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\dfrac{h}{2 \pi}">.</span> Assuming that
the orbit of the electron is circular, this assumption is equivalent
with the assumption that the angular momentum of the electron round the
nucleus is equal to an entire multiple of <span class="nowrap"><img style="vertical-align: -1.577ex; width: 3.416ex; height: 4.676ex;" src="images/172.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\dfrac{h}{2 \pi}">.</span></p>

<p>5. That the “permanent” state of any atomic system—<i>i. e</i>., the
state in which the energy emitted is maximum—is determined by the
condition that the angular momentum of every electron round the centre
of its orbit is equal to <span class="nowrap"><img style="vertical-align: -1.577ex; width: 3.416ex; height: 4.676ex;" src="images/172.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\dfrac{h}{2 \pi}">.</span></p>

<p>It is shown that, applying these assumptions to Rutherford’s atom
model, it is possible to account for the laws of Balmer and Rydberg
connecting the frequency of the different lines in the line-spectrum of
an element. Further, outlines are given of a theory of the constitution
of the atoms of the elements and of the formation of molecules of
chemical combinations, which on several points is shown to be in
approximate agreement with experiments.</p>

<p>The intimate connexion between the present theory and modern theories
of the radiation from a black body and of specific heat is evident;
again, since on the ordinary electrodynamics the magnetic moment due to
an electron rotating in a circular orbit is proportional to the angular
momentum, we shall expect a close relation to the theory of magnetons
proposed by Weiss. The development of a detailed theory of heat
radiation and of magnetism on the basis of the present theory claims,
however, the introduction of additional assumptions about the behaviour
of bound electrons in an electromagnetic field. The writer hopes to
return to these questions later.</p>
